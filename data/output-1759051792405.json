      "# Chapter 1: User Interface Handler\n\nWelcome to the exciting world of game development! In this series, we'll explore the different parts that make up our game, starting with how you, the player, interact with it.\n\nImagine you're playing a game on your computer or phone. How do you tell the game what you want to do? How does the game show you what's happening? That's where the **User Interface Handler** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a simple board game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You need to:\n1.  **See the board**: Where are the X's and O's?\n2.  **Make a move**: Click on an empty square to place your mark.\n3.  **See the result**: Did your move work? Did you win?\n\nWithout a way to do these things, the game would just run by itself, and you couldn't play! The **User Interface Handler** is like the game's eyes and ears, and its mouth. It listens to your actions, translates them for the game's brain, and then shows you what the game's brain decides.\n\n**Our Goal for this Chapter**: Understand how the User Interface Handler acts as the bridge between you and the game, allowing you to click a square and see the game respond.\n\n## The User Interface Handler: Your Game's Best Friend\n\nLet's break down what the User Interface Handler does:\n\n1.  **It Listens to You (Input)**: It constantly watches for your clicks, key presses, or touches. It's like a very attentive waiter waiting for your order.\n2.  **It Shows You Things (Output)**: It's responsible for drawing the game board, showing messages, displaying scores, and generally making sure you can see everything important. This is like the waiter bringing your food and drinks.\n3.  **It Translates Your Actions**: When you click a square, the User Interface Handler doesn't just send \"click!\" to the game. It translates that into something meaningful, like \"Player wants to place a mark on square number 5.\"\n\n## How You \"Use\" the User Interface Handler\n\nAs a player, you don't directly \"call\" the User Interface Handler. Instead, it's always running in the background, ready to react to your actions.\n\nLet's consider our main use case: **Clicking a square on the game board to make a move.**\n\nWhen you click a square on your screen:\n*   The User Interface Handler \"catches\" that click.\n*   It figures out *which* square you clicked.\n*   It then tells the main game logic, \"Hey, the player wants to interact with square (X, Y)!\"\n*   After the game processes your move, the User Interface Handler updates the screen to show the new state of the [Board](02_board.md).\n\nHere's a very simplified idea of what might happen when you click:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of our User Interface Handler\nclass UserInterfaceHandler {\n    // ... other parts of the handler ...\n\n    // This method is called when a player clicks on a visual square\n    handleSquareClick(squareId: string) {\n        console.log(`Player clicked square: ${squareId}`);\n        // In a real game, this would tell the main Game logic\n        // For example: game.makeMove(squareId);\n        // We'll learn more about the Game logic in [Game](04_game.md)!\n    }\n\n    // This method updates what the player sees on the screen\n    updateDisplay(boardData: any) {\n        console.log(\"Updating the game board display...\");\n        // This is where the UI Handler would draw the X's and O's\n        // on the screen based on the latest boardData.\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation**: The `handleSquareClick` method is like the UI Handler noticing you've pointed at something specific. It then logs which `squareId` was clicked. The `updateDisplay` method is how the UI Handler shows you the latest game situation, like drawing an 'X' on the board after a move.\n\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the User Interface Handler connects everything.\n\nThink of the User Interface Handler as a friendly receptionist at a busy hotel.\n\n*   **You (the Player)**: You walk up to the front desk.\n*   **Receptionist (User Interface Handler)**: Greets you and asks what you need.\n*   **Hotel Manager (Game Logic)**: The person who knows all the rules and makes decisions.\n*   **Room Status Board (Game Board)**: Shows which rooms are occupied.\n\nHere's how your request to \"check into a room\" (make a move) might flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UIHandler as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game Logic\n    participant Board as Game Board\n    \n    Player->>UIHandler: Clicks a Square (e.g., \"Square 3\")\n    UIHandler->>Game: Notify: \"Player wants to move on Square 3\"\n    Game->>Game: Process move (e.g., check rules, update Player, Board)\n    Game->>UIHandler: Request: \"Update display with new Board state\"\n    UIHandler->>Board: Get current state of all Squares\n    Board-->>UIHandler: Current Board data (e.g., \"Square 3 now has 'X'\")\n    UIHandler->>Player: Display updated Board on screen\n```\n\n**Step-by-step explanation of the diagram:**\n\n1.  **Player Clicks a Square**: You, the player, click on a visual representation of a [Square](03_square.md) on your screen.\n2.  **UI Handler Notifies Game**: The `User Interface Handler` detects this click. It translates your click into a meaningful message, like \"Player wants to make a move on Square 3,\" and sends it to the main `Game Logic`.\n3.  **Game Processes Move**: The `Game Logic` (which we'll explore in [Game](04_game.md) and [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)) takes this request. It checks if the move is valid, updates the internal game state, and might update the [Player](05_player.md) or the [Board](02_board.md).\n4.  **Game Requests Display Update**: Once the `Game Logic` has finished processing, it tells the `User Interface Handler`, \"Hey, the game state has changed! Please show the player the new situation.\"\n5.  **UI Handler Gets Board State**: The `User Interface Handler` then asks the [Board](02_board.md) for its current data (e.g., which [Square](03_square.md)s have X's, which have O's).\n6.  **Board Provides Data**: The [Board](02_board.md) sends back the information about its current state.\n7.  **UI Handler Displays Updated Board**: Finally, the `User Interface Handler` uses this data to redraw the game board on your screen, showing you the result of your move!\n\nThis entire cycle happens very quickly, making it feel like the game responds instantly to your actions.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we learned that the **User Interface Handler** is the crucial link between you, the player, and the game's internal workings. It's responsible for:\n*   Listening to your input (like clicks).\n*   Translating your input into commands the game understands.\n*   Displaying the game's current state back to you.\n\nIt's like the game's friendly receptionist, ensuring smooth communication!\n\nNow that we understand how you interact with the game, let's dive into what you're actually interacting with: the game board itself.\n\n**Next Chapter**: Let's explore the [Board](02_board.md) and understand how it organizes the game's playing area.",
      "# Chapter 2: Board\n\nWelcome back! In our [previous chapter on the User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), we learned how you, the player, interact with our game. You click buttons, make moves, and the game shows you what's happening. But where do those moves actually *happen*? Where do the game pieces go?\n\nThat's where the **Board** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a physical board game like checkers or chess. You have a physical board with squares, and you place your pieces on those squares. The board is essential because it defines the playing area and holds the current state of the game (where all the pieces are).\n\nIn our digital game, we need a virtual version of that physical board. The `Board` abstraction is like the blueprint and container for our game's playing field. It's responsible for:\n\n1.  **Defining the playing area**: How big is the board? How many squares does it have?\n2.  **Holding the game pieces**: It keeps track of what's on each square.\n3.  **Allowing interaction**: It provides ways to place pieces, remove them, or check what's on a specific spot.\n\nWithout a `Board`, our game pieces would just float in digital space with nowhere to go!\n\n## The Board: A Grid of Possibilities\n\nAt its core, our `Board` is a grid. Think of it like a spreadsheet or a checkerboard. Each cell in that grid is a specific spot where a game piece can be placed. We call these individual spots **Squares**. We'll dive much deeper into [Squares in the next chapter](03_square.md), but for now, just know that the `Board` is made up of many `Square` objects.\n\nLet's look at a simple 3x3 board, like for Tic-Tac-Toe:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Board\n        A1[Square (0,0)] --- A2[Square (0,1)] --- A3[Square (0,2)]\n        B1[Square (1,0)] --- B2[Square (1,1)] --- B3[Square (1,2)]\n        C1[Square (2,0)] --- C2[Square (2,1)] --- C3[Square (2,2)]\n        A1 --- B1 --- C1\n        A2 --- B2 --- C2\n        A3 --- B3 --- C3\n    end\n```\n\nEach `Square` has a unique position (like coordinates `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, etc.) and can hold a game piece or be empty.\n\n## How to Use the Board\n\nLet's imagine we're building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. We'll need to:\n\n1.  **Create a new board**: Set up the playing field.\n2.  **Place a player's mark**: When a player makes a move, we need to update the board.\n3.  **Check a square**: See if a square is empty or occupied.\n\n### 1. Creating a Board\n\nWhen our game starts, one of the first things it does is create a `Board`. This usually involves telling the `Board` how big it should be.\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how you might create a board:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // Imagine this file exists\n\nfunction initializeGame() {\n  const gameBoard = new Board(3, 3); // Create a 3x3 board\n  console.log(\"Board created!\");\n  // ... rest of game setup\n  return gameBoard;\n}\n\nconst myGame = initializeGame();\n// Output: Board created!\n```\n\nIn this example, `new Board(3, 3)` tells the `Board` to set itself up with 3 rows and 3 columns. Internally, it will then create all the individual [Square](03_square.md) objects that make up this grid.\n\n### 2. Placing a Mark on the Board\n\nOnce the board is ready, players will make moves. When a player clicks on a spot (which the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects), the game needs to tell the `Board` to place a piece at that specific location.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists from above\n\nfunction playerMove(row: number, col: number, playerMark: string) {\n  const success = myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(row, col, playerMark);\n  if (success) {\n    console.log(`Placed ${playerMark} at (${row}, ${col})`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Cannot place at (${row}, ${col}). It might be occupied.`);\n  }\n}\n\nplayerMove(0, 0, 'X'); // Player 1 places 'X' at top-left\nplayerMove(1, 1, 'O'); // Player 2 places 'O' in the middle\n// Output:\n// Placed X at (0, 0)\n// Placed O at (1, 1)\n```\n\nThe `placeMark` method is how we update the `Board`'s state. It takes the row, column, and the player's mark (like 'X' or 'O') and tries to put it there.\n\n### 3. Checking a Square\n\nSometimes, the game needs to know what's on a particular square. For example, to check if a square is empty before placing a piece, or to see if a player has won by getting three of their marks in a row.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists and marks have been placed\n\nfunction checkSquareContent(row: number, col: number) {\n  const content = myGame.gameBoard.getMark(row, col);\n  console.log(`Content at (${row}, ${col}): ${content}`);\n}\n\ncheckSquareContent(0, 0); // Check the top-left square\ncheckSquareContent(0, 1); // Check an empty square\n// Output:\n// Content at (0, 0): X\n// Content at (0, 1): Empty\n```\n\nThe `getMark` method allows us to \"look\" at a square and see what's inside without changing anything.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Board Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to understand how the `Board` manages all these [Square](03_square.md) objects and their contents.\n\n### The Board's Internal Structure\n\nWhen you create a `Board`, it doesn't just magically appear. It needs to store all those [Square](03_square.md) objects. A common way to do this is using a 2D array (an array of arrays). Each element in this 2D array would be a reference to a `Square` object.\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\nimport { Square } from './square'; // We'll learn about Square in the next chapter!\n\nexport class Board {\n  private squares: Square[][]; // This will hold our grid of Square objects\n  private rows: number;\n  private cols: number;\n\n  constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n    this.rows = rows;\n    this.cols = cols;\n    this.squares = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n\n    // Loop to create all the individual Square objects\n    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n      this.squares[r] = []; // Create a new row\n      for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n        this.squares[r][c] = new Square(r, c); // Create a new Square for each spot\n      }\n    }\n    console.log(`Board initialized with ${rows * cols} squares.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like placeMark, getMark\n}\n```\n\nWhen `new Board(3, 3)` is called, the `constructor` method runs. It creates a `3x3` grid, and for each spot, it creates a brand new `Square` object, storing it in the `this.squares` array.\n\n### Placing a Mark: A Step-by-Step Process\n\nLet's trace what happens when you call `myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(0, 0, 'X')`:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game\n    participant Board as Board\n    participant Square as Square\n\n    UI->>Game: Player clicks (0,0)\n    Game->>Board: placeMark(0,0, 'X')\n    Board->>Board: Find Square at (0,0)\n    Board->>Square: setMark('X')\n    Square-->>Board: Mark set successfully\n    Board-->>Game: true (mark placed)\n    Game->>UI: Update display\n```\n\n1.  **User Interaction**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects that the player clicked on the top-left square.\n2.  **Game Logic**: The `Game` object (which we'll cover later) receives this input and decides it's a valid move. It then tells the `Board` to place an 'X' at `(0,0)`.\n3.  **Board Locates Square**: The `Board` uses the `(0,0)` coordinates to find the correct `Square` object within its `squares` grid.\n4.  **Square Updates Itself**: The `Board` then tells *that specific* `Square` object to `setMark('X')`. The `Square` checks if it's empty and, if so, updates its internal state to hold 'X'.\n5.  **Confirmation**: The `Square` confirms back to the `Board` that the mark was placed. The `Board` then confirms back to the `Game`.\n6.  **UI Update**: The `Game` tells the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to visually update the board, showing the 'X' in the top-left corner.\n\nHere's how the `placeMark` method might look inside the `Board` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\n// ... inside the Board class\n\n  placeMark(row: number, col: number, mark: string): boolean {\n    // Basic validation: check if coordinates are within board limits\n    if (row < 0 || row >= this.rows || col < 0 || col >= this.cols) {\n      console.error(\"Invalid board coordinates!\");\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    const targetSquare = this.squares[row][col]; // Get the specific Square object\n    return targetSquare.setMark(mark); // Ask the Square to set its mark\n  }\n```\n\nNotice how the `Board` doesn't directly store the 'X' or 'O'. Instead, it delegates that responsibility to the individual `Square` objects. This is a powerful concept in programming: breaking down a big problem (managing a whole board) into smaller, manageable pieces (managing individual squares).\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the `Board` abstraction, which is the digital playing field for our game. We learned:\n\n*   The `Board` defines the game's playing area and holds all the game pieces.\n*   It's essentially a grid made up of many individual [Square](03_square.md) objects.\n*   We can create a `Board`, place marks on it, and check the contents of its squares.\n*   Internally, the `Board` manages a 2D array of [Square](03_square.md) objects and delegates the task of holding marks to those individual squares.\n\nThe `Board` provides the structure, but what about the individual spots on the board? How do they know if they're empty or occupied? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we'll dive into the details of the **Square**!\n\n[Next Chapter: Square](03_square.md)",
      "# Chapter 3: Square\n\nWelcome back, aspiring game developers! In our [previous chapter on the Board](02_board.md), we learned that the `Board` is like the playing surface for our game. It's where all the action happens, holding the structure of our game world. But what exactly *makes up* that board?\n\nImagine a chessboard or a checkerboard. It's not just one big flat surface, right? It's divided into many individual spaces. Each of these spaces is distinct, has its own location, and can hold a game piece. In our game, these individual spaces are represented by the **Square** concept!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You have a 3x3 grid. When you make a move, you don't just say \"I'm putting an 'X' on the board.\" You say, \"I'm putting an 'X' in the *top-left square*\" or \"in the *middle-right square*.\"\n\nThe `Square` concept solves the problem of representing these individual, distinct locations on our [Board](02_board.md). Each `Square` knows:\n\n1.  **Where it is**: Its specific position on the board (like a row and column).\n2.  **What's on it**: Whether it's empty, or if a player's piece is currently occupying it.\n\nWithout `Square`s, our `Board` would just be a big, undifferentiated space, and we wouldn't know *where* to place pieces or *which* space a player is interacting with.\n\n## What is a Square?\n\nAt its core, a `Square` is a simple building block. It's like a single tile on a larger mosaic. Each `Square` object in our game holds just enough information to be useful:\n\n*   **Its Coordinates**: Where it lives on the [Board](02_board.md). We often use `row` and `column` numbers for this.\n*   **Its Current State**: What's currently occupying this `Square`? Is it empty, or does it hold a game piece?\n\nLet's look at a simplified idea of what a `Square` might look like in code:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual)\n\nclass Square {\n  row: number;       // Which row is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  column: number;    // Which column is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  content: any | null; // What's currently on this square? (e.g., a game piece, or null if empty)\n\n  constructor(row: number, column: number) {\n    this.row = row;\n    this.column = column;\n    this.content = null; // A new square starts empty\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods to check/set content ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when we create a `Square`, we tell it its `row` and `column`. Initially, its `content` is `null`, meaning it's empty.\n\n### How the Board Uses Squares\n\nThe [Board](02_board.md) doesn't just exist; it's made up of many `Square`s! Imagine the `Board` as a grid, and each cell in that grid is an instance of our `Square` class.\n\nWhen the [Board](02_board.md) is created, it creates all the `Square` objects it needs and arranges them. For example, a 3x3 board would create 9 `Square` objects.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Board] --> B[Square (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Square (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Square (0,2)]\n    A --> E[Square (1,0)]\n    A --> F[Square (1,1)]\n    A --> G[Square (1,2)]\n    A --> H[Square (2,0)]\n    A --> I[Square (2,1)]\n    A --> J[Square (2,2)]\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style I fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style J fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nThis diagram shows how a `Board` is composed of many individual `Square` objects, each with its own unique coordinates.\n\n## How to Interact with a Square\n\nAs a player, you don't directly interact with `Square` objects. Instead, you click on a visual representation of a square on your screen. The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) then translates that click into a request to the [Board](02_board.md), which then interacts with the specific `Square` object.\n\nLet's imagine we want to place a piece on a square.\n\n1.  **Check if it's empty**: Before placing a piece, we need to know if the `Square` is already occupied.\n2.  **Place a piece**: If it's empty, we can update the `Square`'s `content`.\n\nHere's how we might add simple methods to our `Square` class to do this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual - continued)\n\nclass Square {\n  // ... (row, column, content, constructor as above) ...\n\n  isEmpty(): boolean {\n    return this.content === null; // Is there nothing on this square?\n  }\n\n  placePiece(piece: any): void { // 'any' would be a specific game piece type\n    if (this.isEmpty()) {\n      this.content = piece; // Put the piece on the square\n      console.log(`Piece placed at (${this.row}, ${this.column})`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(`Square at (${this.row}, ${this.column}) is already occupied!`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  getPiece(): any | null {\n    return this.content; // What piece is on this square?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nLet's create a square and try to place a piece on it.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is happening inside the Board or Game logic\nconst mySquare = new Square(1, 1); // Create a square at row 1, column 1\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty? true\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"X\"); // Place an 'X' piece\n// Output: Piece placed at (1, 1)\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty now? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty now? false\n\nconsole.log(`What's on the square? ${mySquare.getPiece()}`);\n// Output: What's on the square? X\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"O\"); // Try to place another piece\n// Output: Square at (1, 1) is already occupied!\n```\n\nThis simple example shows how a `Square` object can manage its own state (what's on it) and provide methods to query or change that state.\n\n## How it Works Internally: A Player's Move\n\nLet's trace a simple interaction: a player clicks on an empty square to place their piece.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Board\n    participant Square\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on screen at (x,y)\n    UI->>Board: \"Player wants to place piece at (row, col)\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Hey Square (row, col), are you empty?\"\n    Square-->>Board: \"Yes, I am empty!\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Great! Place Player's piece on yourself.\"\n    Square->>Square: Updates its 'content' property\n    Square-->>Board: \"Piece placed!\"\n    Board-->>UI: \"Move successful!\"\n    UI->>Player: Updates screen to show new piece\n```\n\n1.  **Player Clicks**: You, the `Player`, click on a visual square on the screen.\n2.  **UI Notifies Board**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click and figures out which `row` and `column` on the game board corresponds to that click. It then tells the `Board` that the player wants to make a move at that specific location.\n3.  **Board Consults Square**: The `Board` then finds the correct `Square` object at the given `row` and `column` from its collection of squares. It asks that `Square`, \"Are you currently empty?\"\n4.  **Square Responds**: The `Square` checks its `content` property. If `content` is `null`, it reports back to the `Board` that it's empty.\n5.  **Board Instructs Square**: Since the `Square` is empty, the `Board` tells the `Square` to `placePiece()` on itself, passing the player's piece.\n6.  **Square Updates**: The `Square` updates its internal `content` property to now hold the player's piece.\n7.  **Success Notification**: The `Square` confirms the piece is placed, the `Board` confirms the move, and the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) updates the visual display for the `Player`.\n\nThis flow shows how the `Square` is a crucial, self-contained unit that manages its own small piece of the game state, allowing the `Board` to coordinate larger game logic.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `Square` concept, understanding it as the fundamental building block of our game [Board](02_board.md). We learned that each `Square` knows its position (row and column) and what content it holds (or if it's empty). We saw how simple methods allow us to check and modify a `Square`'s state, and how the `Board` relies on `Square`s to manage the game's physical layout.\n\nThe `Square` is a small but mighty component, essential for defining the spaces where our game pieces will reside and where players will interact.\n\nNow that we understand the individual `Square`s and how they form the `Board`, it's time to bring everything together and see how the entire **Game** operates!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game](04_game.md)",
      "# Chapter 4: Game\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've explored the foundational elements of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), which lets you interact with the game. Then, we moved to the [Board](02_board.md), the playing surface, and finally, we zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board.\n\nBut what brings all these pieces together? How do we go from a collection of squares to an actual *game* that you can play? That's where the **Game** abstraction comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're directing a play. You have the stage (`Board`), the individual props (`Square`s), and soon, we'll have the actors (`Player`s). But who tells everyone what to do? Who sets up the stage before the show, tells the actors when to enter, and makes sure the play follows its script?\n\nThat's the role of the `Game`! It's the **main director** or **orchestrator** of our entire game system. Its job is to:\n\n1.  **Set up the stage**: Create the [Board](02_board.md) and prepare it for play.\n2.  **Gather the actors**: Create the [Player](05_player.md)s who will participate.\n3.  **Start the show**: Kick off the game and manage its overall flow from beginning to end.\n4.  **Keep track of the big picture**: Know whose turn it is, if the game is over, and what the current situation is.\n\nWithout `Game`, we'd just have a bunch of disconnected parts. `Game` is what transforms those parts into a playable experience.\n\n## The Director's Role: Key Responsibilities of `Game`\n\nLet's break down the main things our `Game` director is responsible for:\n\n### 1. Initialization: Setting Up the Scene\n\nBefore any action can happen, the `Game` needs to set everything up. This means:\n\n*   Creating a new [Board](02_board.md) instance.\n*   Creating the necessary [Player](05_player.md) instances (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2).\n*   Placing initial game pieces or setting up the board according to the game's rules.\n\n### 2. Orchestration: Guiding the Flow\n\nOnce everything is set up, the `Game` is responsible for guiding the overall flow. While a separate [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) will handle the detailed turn-by-turn logic, the `Game` is the one that *starts* that process and knows when the game has reached its conclusion.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start Game] --> B{Game Initialization};\n    B --> C[Create Board];\n    C --> D[Create Players];\n    D --> E[Place Initial Pieces];\n    E --> F[Begin Game Loop / Turns];\n    F --> G{Game Over?};\n    G -- No --> F;\n    G -- Yes --> H[End Game];\n```\n\nThis diagram shows the high-level flow that the `Game` manages.\n\n## How to Start a New Game\n\nTo get our game running, we simply need to create an instance of our `Game` and tell it to `start()`.\n\nHere's how you might do it in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// src/main.ts (simplified)\nimport { Game } from './game'; // Imagine 'game.ts' exists\n\nexport class App {\n  start() {\n    console.log('Starting the application...');\n\n    // 1. Create a new Game instance\n    const myGame = new Game();\n\n    // 2. Tell the game to start!\n    myGame.start();\n\n    console.log('Game has been initialized and started!');\n  }\n}\n\n// To run this, you'd typically create an App instance and call start()\n// const app = new App();\n// app.start();\n```\n\n**What happens when `myGame.start()` is called?**\n\nWhen you call `start()` on a `Game` object, it kicks off the entire game setup process. You won't see immediate visual output from this tiny snippet, but behind the scenes, the `Game` is busy creating the [Board](02_board.md), setting up [Player](05_player.md)s, and getting ready for the first move. It's like the director shouting \"Action!\"\n\n## Under the Hood: How `Game` Works Internally\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain and see what our `Game` director does when you call `start()`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n\nWhen `game.start()` is called, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n1.  The `App` (our main application entry point) tells the `Game` to `start()`.\n2.  The `Game` first creates a new [Board](02_board.md). This board will be the playing field.\n3.  Next, the `Game` creates the necessary [Player](05_player.md) objects.\n4.  The `Game` then tells the newly created [Board](02_board.md) to set itself up, perhaps by placing initial game pieces on specific [Square](03_square.md)s.\n5.  Finally, the `Game` might inform the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) that the game has started and it's time to display the initial board state to the player. It then hands over control to the [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) to manage the actual turns.\n\nHere's a sequence diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as App\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Board\n    participant P as Player\n    participant U as UI Handler\n\n    A->G: start()\n    G->B: new Board()\n    G->P: new Player(1)\n    G->P: new Player(2)\n    G->B: initializeBoard(players)\n    B->>U: updateDisplay(initialState)\n    G->>G: (Hands over to Game State Machine)\n```\n\n### Diving into the Code\n\nLet's look at a simplified version of the `Game` class to see how it performs these steps.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // We'll learn about Board in Chapter 2\nimport { Player } from './player'; // We'll learn about Player in Chapter 5\nimport { UserInterfaceHandler } from './user_interface_handler'; // Chapter 1\n\nexport class Game {\n  private board: Board;\n  private players: Player[];\n  private uiHandler: UserInterfaceHandler;\n\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('Game: Initializing...');\n    this.uiHandler = new UserInterfaceHandler(); // Create UI handler\n    this.board = new Board(); // Create the Board\n    this.players = [\n      new Player('Player 1'), // Create Player 1\n      new Player('Player 2')  // Create Player 2\n    ];\n    console.log('Game: Board and Players created.');\n  }\n\n  start(): void {\n    console.log('Game: Starting the game!');\n    // Tell the board to set up its initial state\n    this.board.initialize(this.players);\n\n    // Tell the UI to display the initial board\n    this.uiHandler.displayBoard(this.board);\n\n    console.log('Game: Initial setup complete. Ready for turns!');\n    // In a real game, we'd now hand over to a Game State Machine\n    // to manage turns and game logic. (See Chapter 6!)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`constructor()`**: This special method runs automatically when you create a new `Game` object (`new Game()`). Inside, it's busy creating the essential components: a `UserInterfaceHandler`, a `Board`, and two `Player` objects. It's like the director preparing the stage and gathering the actors before the play even begins.\n*   **`start()`**: This method is called when you want the game to actually begin. It tells the `board` to `initialize()` itself (e.g., place pieces), and then tells the `uiHandler` to `displayBoard()` so you can see what's happening. After this, the game is ready for action!\n\nNotice how the `Game` class acts as a central hub, bringing together instances of `Board`, `Player`, and `UserInterfaceHandler`. It doesn't *do* everything itself, but it knows *who* needs to do what and when.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've met the **Game** abstraction, the central director of our entire game system. We learned that `Game` is responsible for:\n\n*   **Orchestrating** the entire game flow.\n*   **Initializing** the [Board](02_board.md) and [Player](05_player.md)s.\n*   **Starting** the game and preparing it for play.\n\nIt's the glue that holds all the other pieces together, transforming individual components into a cohesive, playable experience.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Game` sets up the stage and gets everything ready, it's time to introduce the stars of the show: the players! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the **Player** abstraction and understand their role in the game.\n\n[Next Chapter: Player](05_player.md)",
      "# Chapter 5: Player\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've built up the core physical components of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for interaction, then moved to the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing surface, and finally zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board. Most recently, in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md), we saw how the `Game` class brings all these pieces together to form a playable experience.\n\nBut who *plays* the game? Who makes the moves? Who owns the pieces on the [Board](02_board.md)? That's where the **Player** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two participants: one player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. The game needs to keep track of whose turn it is, which symbol belongs to which player, and eventually, who won.\n\nThe `Player` abstraction solves this problem by representing these participants in our game's code. It's like giving each person playing the game a unique identity within the software. Without a `Player` concept, the game wouldn't know who is making a move or whose turn it is, leading to a very confusing and unplayable experience!\n\n## What is a Player?\n\nAt its core, a `Player` is a simple concept: it's an entity that participates in the game. For our purposes, a `Player` needs a few key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Identity**: A way to distinguish one player from another. In Tic-Tac-Toe, this might be their symbol ('X' or 'O').\n2.  **Turn Management**: The game needs to know which `Player` is currently active and allowed to make a move.\n3.  **Ownership**: Players often \"own\" certain elements in the game, like their pieces on the [Board](02_board.md) or the [Square](03_square.md)s they've claimed.\n\nThink of a `Player` as a \"role\" in the game. Just like in a play, each actor has a role, and that role defines what they can do and what they represent. In our game, the `Player` role defines who is 'X' and who is 'O'.\n\n## How the Game Uses Players\n\nThe `Game` class (which we discussed in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) needs to know about the `Player`s to manage the game flow. For example, when it's time for a move, the `Game` will ask the *current* `Player` to make their move.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how a `Player` might be created and identified:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of setting up our game\nclass Player {\n  private symbol: string; // e.g., 'X' or 'O'\n\n  constructor(symbol: string) {\n    this.symbol = symbol;\n  }\n\n  getSymbol(): string {\n    return this.symbol;\n  }\n}\n\n// Creating two players for our game\nconst playerX = new Player('X');\nconst playerO = new Player('O');\n\nconsole.log(`Player 1 is: ${playerX.getSymbol()}`);\nconsole.log(`Player 2 is: ${playerO.getSymbol()}`);\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a `Player` class that can hold a `symbol` (like 'X' or 'O').\n*   When we create a new `Player` object, we give it its unique symbol.\n*   We can then ask the `Player` object what its symbol is using `getSymbol()`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nPlayer 1 is: X\nPlayer 2 is: O\n```\n\nThis simple setup allows the `Game` to keep track of who is who.\n\n## Inside the Player Abstraction\n\nSo, what happens \"under the hood\" when we talk about `Player`s in our game?\n\nWhen the game starts, the `Game` needs to set up the `Player`s. It creates instances of the `Player` class, giving each one its unique identifier (like 'X' or 'O'). Then, as the game progresses, the `Game` will interact with these `Player` objects to manage turns and actions.\n\nHere's a simple sequence of how the `Game` might interact with `Player`s to manage turns:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Game\n    participant PlayerX as Player 'X'\n    participant PlayerO as Player 'O'\n\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n    PlayerX-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerO: It's your turn!\n    PlayerO-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  The `Game` starts and tells `Player 'X'` that it's their turn.\n2.  `Player 'X'` performs an action (like placing their symbol on a [Square](03_square.md)).\n3.  Once `Player 'X'` is done, the `Game` then tells `Player 'O'` that it's their turn.\n4.  This cycle continues, with the `Game` orchestrating whose turn it is by communicating with the `Player` objects.\n\n### Player Code Structure\n\nWhile our `src/main.ts` file is currently very minimal, in a real game, you would likely have a dedicated file for the `Player` class. Let's imagine what that might look like:\n\n```typescript\n// src/player.ts (This is an imagined file for our Player class)\n\nexport class Player {\n  private id: string; // A unique identifier for the player, e.g., 'X', 'O', 'Player 1'\n\n  constructor(id: string) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n\n  // Returns the player's unique identifier\n  getId(): string {\n    return this.id;\n  }\n\n  // In a more complex game, a player might have a score,\n  // or a list of pieces they own. For now, we keep it simple.\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a class `Player` with a `private id` property. This `id` is what makes each player unique.\n*   The `constructor` sets this `id` when a new `Player` is created.\n*   The `getId()` method allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask who this player is.\n\nNow, let's see how the `Game` class might use these `Player` objects:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Simplified example, building on Chapter 4)\nimport { Player } from './player'; // Assuming Player is in its own file\n\nexport class Game {\n  private players: Player[]; // An array to hold all players\n  private currentPlayerIndex: number; // To track whose turn it is\n\n  constructor() {\n    // Initialize our players when the game starts\n    this.players = [new Player('X'), new Player('O')];\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = 0; // Start with the first player (Player 'X')\n    // ... other game setup like creating the Board\n  }\n\n  // Returns the Player object whose turn it currently is\n  getCurrentPlayer(): Player {\n    return this.players[this.currentPlayerIndex];\n  }\n\n  // Advances to the next player's turn\n  nextTurn(): void {\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = (this.currentPlayerIndex + 1) % this.players.length;\n    console.log(`It's now ${this.getCurrentPlayer().getId()}'s turn.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other game logic\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `Game` class now has a `players` array to store all the `Player` objects.\n*   `currentPlayerIndex` keeps track of which player in the array is currently active.\n*   `getCurrentPlayer()` lets any part of the game know who is currently playing.\n*   `nextTurn()` is a simple way to switch to the other player. The `%` (modulo) operator ensures we loop back to the first player after the last player has taken their turn.\n\nThis shows how the `Game` class acts as the manager, using the `Player` objects to keep track of the participants and whose turn it is.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've introduced the `Player` abstraction, which is crucial for any interactive game. We learned that a `Player` represents a participant in the game, providing them with an identity and allowing the game to manage turns and ownership. We saw how the `Game` class uses `Player` objects to keep track of who is playing and whose turn it is.\n\nUnderstanding the `Player` is key to building a dynamic and interactive game. But how does the game *know* what state it's in (e.g., \"X's turn,\" \"Game Over,\" \"X Wins\") and what actions are allowed at any given moment? That's what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into the **Game State Machine**!\n\n[Chapter 6: Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)",
      "# Chapter 6: Game State Machine\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! So far, we've assembled the core pieces of our game. We have the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for player interaction, the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing field, and individual [Square](03_square.md)s making up that board. We also have the overarching [Game](04_game.md) class that brings everything together, and the [Player](05_player.md)s who participate in the game.\n\nBut think about a game you play. It doesn't just *exist*. It goes through different phases, right? First, it might be \"waiting for players,\" then \"player 1's turn,\" then \"player 2's turn,\" and eventually \"game over.\" How do we manage these different phases and ensure the game behaves correctly at each stage?\n\nThat's where the **Game State Machine** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine a simple traffic light. It's not always green, or always red. It cycles through different \"states\": Red, Yellow, Green. And it only changes from Red to Green *after* Yellow, not directly. It follows a specific set of rules for changing states.\n\nOur game is similar! It needs to know what \"state\" it's currently in to decide what actions are allowed and what should happen next. For example:\n*   If it's \"Player 1's Turn,\" only Player 1 should be able to make a move.\n*   If the game is \"Over,\" no more moves should be allowed.\n*   If the game is \"Starting,\" we might need to set up the [Board](02_board.md) and assign [Player](05_player.md)s.\n\nWithout a `Game State Machine`, managing these different phases and rules can become very messy, with lots of `if/else` statements scattered throughout your code. The `Game State Machine` provides a clean, organized way to handle these different stages of your game.\n\n## Understanding Game States and Transitions\n\nThe `Game State Machine` is built on two main ideas:\n\n1.  **States:** These are the distinct phases or conditions your game can be in. Think of them as snapshots of your game's current situation.\n    *   Examples: `WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, `Player2Turn`, `GameOver`, `Paused`.\n2.  **Transitions:** These are the rules that define how your game moves from one state to another. A transition is usually triggered by an \"event.\"\n    *   Examples:\n        *   From `WaitingToStart` to `Player1Turn` (event: \"Game Started\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn` (event: \"Player 1 Made Valid Move\").\n        *   From `Player2Turn` to `GameOver` (event: \"Player 2 Won\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Paused` (event: \"Player Pressed Pause Button\").\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[WaitingToStart] -->|Game Started| B(Player1Turn)\n    B -->|Player 1 Made Move| C(Player2Turn)\n    C -->|Player 2 Made Move| B\n    B -->|Player 1 Won| D{GameOver}\n    C -->|Player 2 Won| D\n    B -->|Player Pressed Pause| E[Paused]\n    E -->|Player Pressed Resume| B\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   The boxes (`WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, etc.) are our **states**.\n*   The arrows are our **transitions**, and the text on the arrows describes the **events** that trigger them.\n\n## How the Game State Machine Works in Our Game\n\nThe `Game` class (from [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) will rely on the `Game State Machine` to know what's currently happening and what actions are allowed.\n\nLet's say a [Player](05_player.md) tries to make a move.\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click.\n2.  It tells the `Game` class about the attempted move.\n3.  The `Game` class then asks the `Game State Machine`: \"Is a move allowed in the current state, and if so, whose turn is it?\"\n4.  The `Game State Machine` checks its current state (e.g., `Player1Turn`). If it's `Player1Turn` and Player 1 made the move, it allows it and then tells the `Game` to update the [Board](02_board.md) and transition to `Player2Turn`.\n\n### Example: Changing Turns\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how the `Game` might interact with a `Game State Machine`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Conceptual)\n\nimport { GameStateMachine, GameState } from './gameStateMachine'; // Imagine this file exists\nimport { Player } from './player'; // From Chapter 5\n\nclass Game {\n  private stateMachine: GameStateMachine;\n  // ... other game properties like board, players\n\n  constructor(player1: Player, player2: Player) {\n    // ... initialize board, players\n    this.stateMachine = new GameStateMachine();\n    this.stateMachine.transition('GAME_STARTED'); // Initial transition\n  }\n\n  handlePlayerMove(player: Player, squareId: string): void {\n    // Check if the move is valid for the current game state\n    if (this.stateMachine.canTransition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE', player)) {\n      // Perform the move on the board (details from Chapter 2 & 3)\n      // ... logic to update the Board ...\n\n      // If move was successful, transition the game state\n      this.stateMachine.transition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE');\n\n      // Update UI to reflect new state (e.g., whose turn it is)\n      // this.uiHandler.updateTurnDisplay(this.stateMachine.getCurrentPlayer());\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Invalid move for current game state or player!\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... other game methods\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The `Game` class creates an instance of `GameStateMachine`.\n*   When the game starts, it tells the `stateMachine` to transition to the initial state (`GAME_STARTED`).\n*   When a player tries to move, the `Game` first asks the `stateMachine` if such a transition (`PLAYER_MADE_MOVE`) is allowed for the current player.\n*   If allowed, the `Game` performs the actual move and then tells the `stateMachine` to update its internal state, which might change whose turn it is.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Game State Machine Manages States\n\nLet's peek inside the `Game State Machine` itself. It needs to keep track of the current state and have rules for how to change it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Flow\n\nWhen an event happens (like a player making a move), here's how the `Game State Machine` helps manage the flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GSM as Game State Machine\n\n    UI->>G: Player clicked Square (e.g., \"A1\")\n    G->>GSM: Request: Can I process 'PLAYER_MOVE' event?\n    GSM-->>G: Response: Yes, current state is 'Player1Turn'.\n    G->>G: Process player move on Board\n    G->>GSM: Notify: 'PLAYER_MOVE' event occurred.\n    GSM->>GSM: Update current state to 'Player2Turn'.\n    GSM-->>G: Response: State updated to 'Player2Turn'.\n    G->>UI: Update UI (e.g., \"Player 2's Turn\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects a player's action and informs the `Game`.\n2.  The `Game` doesn't just blindly execute the action. It first consults the `Game State Machine` to ask, \"Is this action (`PLAYER_MOVE`) valid right now?\"\n3.  The `Game State Machine` checks its `currentState` (e.g., `Player1Turn`) and its internal rules. If the action is valid for that state, it responds \"Yes.\"\n4.  The `Game` then proceeds to perform the actual game logic (like placing a piece on the [Board](02_board.md)).\n5.  After the game logic is done, the `Game` tells the `Game State Machine` that the `PLAYER_MOVE` event has successfully occurred.\n6.  The `Game State Machine` then updates its `currentState` based on its rules (e.g., from `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn`).\n7.  Finally, the `Game` can tell the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to update what the player sees, reflecting the new game state.\n\n### Conceptual Code for Game State Machine\n\nThe `Game State Machine` itself might look something like this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameStateMachine.ts (Conceptual)\n\nexport enum GameState {\n  WaitingToStart = \"WAITING_TO_START\",\n  Player1Turn = \"PLAYER_1_TURN\",\n  Player2Turn = \"PLAYER_2_TURN\",\n  GameOver = \"GAME_OVER\",\n  Paused = \"PAUSED\",\n}\n\nexport class GameStateMachine {\n  private currentState: GameState;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.currentState = GameState.WaitingToStart; // Start here\n  }\n\n  getCurrentState(): GameState {\n    return this.currentState;\n  }\n\n  transition(event: string): void {\n    switch (this.currentState) {\n      case GameState.WaitingToStart:\n        if (event === 'GAME_STARTED') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player1Turn;\n          console.log(\"Game started! It's Player 1's turn.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      case GameState.Player1Turn:\n        if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE') {\n          // Check for win/draw conditions here in a real game\n          // For simplicity, let's just switch turns\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player2Turn;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 moved. It's Player 2's turn.\");\n        } else if (event === 'PLAYER_WON') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.GameOver;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 won! Game Over.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      // ... cases for Player2Turn, GameOver, Paused\n      default:\n        console.log(`Event '${event}' not handled in state ${this.currentState}`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // A method to check if a transition is allowed *before* making it\n  canTransition(event: string, player?: any): boolean {\n    // This would contain more complex logic in a real game\n    // For example, checking if 'player' matches the current turn\n    if (this.currentState === GameState.GameOver) return false;\n    if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE' && \n        (this.currentState === GameState.Player1Turn || this.currentState === GameState.Player2Turn)) {\n        // In a real game, check if 'player' is the current player\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   We define an `enum` called `GameState` to clearly list all possible states.\n*   The `GameStateMachine` class holds the `currentState`.\n*   The `transition` method is the heart of it. When an `event` occurs, it uses a `switch` statement to check the `currentState` and then decides if and how to change to a `nextState`.\n*   The `canTransition` method is a helper that allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask if a certain action is valid *before* trying to perform it. This helps prevent illegal moves.\n\nThis structured approach makes your game logic much easier to understand, maintain, and extend. If you want to add a \"Pause\" state, you just add it to the `GameState` enum and update the `transition` logic in one place.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the **Game State Machine**, a powerful concept for managing the different phases and behaviors of our game. We learned that:\n*   Games go through distinct **states** (like `Player1Turn` or `GameOver`).\n*   **Events** trigger **transitions** between these states according to defined rules.\n*   The `Game State Machine` provides a centralized and organized way for the `Game` class to manage its flow, ensuring that actions are only performed when appropriate for the current game phase.\n\nWith the `Game State Machine`, our game can now intelligently respond to player actions and progress through its lifecycle in a predictable and robust way. We've now covered all the core components of our game's architecture!"

Here is how the solution was designed:\n\n### Tic Tac Toe OOP Design\n\nFirst, what are components, processes, and data involved in tic tac toe?  Here is a brain dump of all of the things I can think of:\n\n* Board\n* Player\n* X's, O's\n* Squares\n* Turns (Maybe?)\n* Game\n* Winner/Loser\n\nNow let's organize these thoughts a little more using words like has, owns, uses:\n\n* There is 1 board\n* A board has squares\n* Squares can be X, O or empty\n* There is 1 game\n* A game has 2 players\n* A game should decide whose turn it is\n* A game has a board\n* The game decides who wins or loses based on the board\n* A board view can be displayed using a board\n\n### Tic Tac Toe OOP Code\n\nNow that we have high level design requirements, let's think of what classes we will need:\n\n* game.js - A game of tic tac toe\n* board.js - A tic tac toe game board\n* player.js - A single player\n* square.js - A square in the tic tac toe game board\n\n\nAdditionally, we'll need a `main.js` to create an instance of the game and interact with the html on the page.\n\n#### game.js\n\nCreates an instance of a board, two players and keeps track of whose turn it is.  The game will be responsible for making a move on the board and making sure that the move is valid.  Also, it will be able to identify when someone has won.\n\n#### board.js\n\nCreates a 2 dimensional array of new square objects (details about square.js below).  The board is a state machine, which means that it keeps tracks of different game states.\n\nThe possible states of the board are:\n\n* PLAYING\n* X_WINS\n* O_WINS\n* TIE\n\nThe board can tell you if a square is empty and can also check if someone has won or tied the game.\n\n#### player.js\n\nA player keeps track of the type of player (X or O) and the name of the player (if you want to display that).\n\n#### square.js\n\nA square can have 3 states: empty, X, or O.\n```",

Here is a brain dump of all of the things I can think of:\n\n* Board\n* Player\n* X's, O's\n* Squares\n* Turns (Maybe?)\n* Game\n* Winner/Loser\n\nNow let's organize these thoughts a little more using words like has, owns, uses:\n\n* There is 1 board\n* A board has squares\n* Squares can be X, O or empty\n* There is 1 game\n* A game has 2 players\n* A game should decide whose turn it is\n* A game has a board\n* The game decides who wins or loses based on the board\n* A board view can be displayed using a board\n\n### Tic Tac Toe OOP Code\n\nNow that we have high level design requirements, let's think of what classes we will need:\n\n* game.js - A game of tic tac toe\n* board.js - A tic tac toe game board\n* player.js - A single player\n* square.js - A square in the tic tac toe game board\n\n\nAdditionally, we'll need a `main.js` to create an instance of the game and interact with the html on the page.\n\n#### game.js\n\nCreates an instance of a board, two players and keeps track of whose turn it is.  The game will be responsible for making a move on the board and making sure that the move is valid.  Also, it will be able to identify when someone has won.\n\n#### board.js\n\nCreates a 2 dimensional array of new square objects (details about square.js below).  The board is a state machine, which means that it keeps tracks of different game states.\n\nThe possible states of the board are:\n\n* PLAYING\n* X_WINS\n* O_WINS\n* TIE\n\nThe board can tell you if a square is empty and can also check if someone has won or tied the game.\n\n#### player.js\n\nA player keeps track of the type of player (X or O) and the name of the player (if you want to display that).\n\n#### square.js\n\nA square can have 3 states: empty, X, or O.\n```",

Here is how the solution was designed:\n\n### Tic Tac Toe OOP Design\n\nFirst, what are components, processes, and data involved in tic tac toe?  Here is a brain dump of all of the things I can think of:\n\n* Board\n* Player\n* X's, O's\n* Squares\n* Turns (Maybe?)\n* Game\n* Winner/Loser\n\nNow let's organize these thoughts a little more using words like has, owns, uses:\n\n* There is 1 board\n* A board has squares\n* Squares can be X, O or empty\n* There is 1 game\n* A game has 2 players\n* A game should decide whose turn it is\n* A game has a board\n* The game decides who wins or loses based on the board\n* A board view can be displayed using a board\n\n### Tic Tac Toe OOP Code\n\nNow that we have high level design requirements, let's think of what classes we will need:\n\n* game.js - A game of tic tac toe\n* board.js - A tic tac toe game board\n* player.js - A single player\n* square.js - A square in the tic tac toe game board\n\n\nAdditionally, we'll need a `main.js` to create an instance of the game and interact with the html on the page.\n\n#### game.js\n\nCreates an instance of a board, two players and keeps track of whose turn it is.  The game will be responsible for making a move on the board and making sure that the move is valid.  Also, it will be able to identify when someone has won.\n\n#### board.js\n\nCreates a 2 dimensional array of new square objects (details about square.js below).  The board is a state machine, which means that it keeps tracks of different game states.\n\nThe possible states of the board are:\n\n* PLAYING\n* X_WINS\n* O_WINS\n* TIE\n\nThe board can tell you if a square is empty and can also check if someone has won or tied the game.\n\n#### player.js\n\nA player keeps track of the type of player (X or O) and the name of the player (if you want to display that).\n\n#### square.js\n\nA square can have 3 states: empty, X, or O.\n```",

          "# Chapter 1: User Interface Handler\n\nWelcome to the exciting world of game development! In this series, we'll explore the different parts that make up our game, starting with how you, the player, interact with it.\n\nImagine you're playing a game on your computer or phone. How do you tell the game what you want to do? How does the game show you what's happening? That's where the **User Interface Handler** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a simple board game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You need to:\n1.  **See the board**: Where are the X's and O's?\n2.  **Make a move**: Click on an empty square to place your mark.\n3.  **See the result**: Did your move work? Did you win?\n\nWithout a way to do these things, the game would just run by itself, and you couldn't play! The **User Interface Handler** is like the game's eyes and ears, and its mouth. It listens to your actions, translates them for the game's brain, and then shows you what the game's brain decides.\n\n**Our Goal for this Chapter**: Understand how the User Interface Handler acts as the bridge between you and the game, allowing you to click a square and see the game respond.\n\n## The User Interface Handler: Your Game's Best Friend\n\nLet's break down what the User Interface Handler does:\n\n1.  **It Listens to You (Input)**: It constantly watches for your clicks, key presses, or touches. It's like a very attentive waiter waiting for your order.\n2.  **It Shows You Things (Output)**: It's responsible for drawing the game board, showing messages, displaying scores, and generally making sure you can see everything important. This is like the waiter bringing your food and drinks.\n3.  **It Translates Your Actions**: When you click a square, the User Interface Handler doesn't just send \"click!\" to the game. It translates that into something meaningful, like \"Player wants to place a mark on square number 5.\"\n\n## How You \"Use\" the User Interface Handler\n\nAs a player, you don't directly \"call\" the User Interface Handler. Instead, it's always running in the background, ready to react to your actions.\n\nLet's consider our main use case: **Clicking a square on the game board to make a move.**\n\nWhen you click a square on your screen:\n*   The User Interface Handler \"catches\" that click.\n*   It figures out *which* square you clicked.\n*   It then tells the main game logic, \"Hey, the player wants to interact with square (X, Y)!\"\n*   After the game processes your move, the User Interface Handler updates the screen to show the new state of the [Board](02_board.md).\n\nHere's a very simplified idea of what might happen when you click:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of our User Interface Handler\nclass UserInterfaceHandler {\n    // ... other parts of the handler ...\n\n    // This method is called when a player clicks on a visual square\n    handleSquareClick(squareId: string) {\n        console.log(`Player clicked square: ${squareId}`);\n        // In a real game, this would tell the main Game logic\n        // For example: game.makeMove(squareId);\n        // We'll learn more about the Game logic in [Game](04_game.md)!\n    }\n\n    // This method updates what the player sees on the screen\n    updateDisplay(boardData: any) {\n        console.log(\"Updating the game board display...\");\n        // This is where the UI Handler would draw the X's and O's\n        // on the screen based on the latest boardData.\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation**: The `handleSquareClick` method is like the UI Handler noticing you've pointed at something specific. It then logs which `squareId` was clicked. The `updateDisplay` method is how the UI Handler shows you the latest game situation, like drawing an 'X' on the board after a move.\n\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the User Interface Handler connects everything.\n\nThink of the User Interface Handler as a friendly receptionist at a busy hotel.\n\n*   **You (the Player)**: You walk up to the front desk.\n*   **Receptionist (User Interface Handler)**: Greets you and asks what you need.\n*   **Hotel Manager (Game Logic)**: The person who knows all the rules and makes decisions.\n*   **Room Status Board (Game Board)**: Shows which rooms are occupied.\n\nHere's how your request to \"check into a room\" (make a move) might flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UIHandler as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game Logic\n    participant Board as Game Board\n    \n    Player->>UIHandler: Clicks a Square (e.g., \"Square 3\")\n    UIHandler->>Game: Notify: \"Player wants to move on Square 3\"\n    Game->>Game: Process move (e.g., check rules, update Player, Board)\n    Game->>UIHandler: Request: \"Update display with new Board state\"\n    UIHandler->>Board: Get current state of all Squares\n    Board-->>UIHandler: Current Board data (e.g., \"Square 3 now has 'X'\")\n    UIHandler->>Player: Display updated Board on screen\n```\n\n**Step-by-step explanation of the diagram:**\n\n1.  **Player Clicks a Square**: You, the player, click on a visual representation of a [Square](03_square.md) on your screen.\n2.  **UI Handler Notifies Game**: The `User Interface Handler` detects this click. It translates your click into a meaningful message, like \"Player wants to make a move on Square 3,\" and sends it to the main `Game Logic`.\n3.  **Game Processes Move**: The `Game Logic` (which we'll explore in [Game](04_game.md) and [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)) takes this request. It checks if the move is valid, updates the internal game state, and might update the [Player](05_player.md) or the [Board](02_board.md).\n4.  **Game Requests Display Update**: Once the `Game Logic` has finished processing, it tells the `User Interface Handler`, \"Hey, the game state has changed! Please show the player the new situation.\"\n5.  **UI Handler Gets Board State**: The `User Interface Handler` then asks the [Board](02_board.md) for its current data (e.g., which [Square](03_square.md)s have X's, which have O's).\n6.  **Board Provides Data**: The [Board](02_board.md) sends back the information about its current state.\n7.  **UI Handler Displays Updated Board**: Finally, the `User Interface Handler` uses this data to redraw the game board on your screen, showing you the result of your move!\n\nThis entire cycle happens very quickly, making it feel like the game responds instantly to your actions.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we learned that the **User Interface Handler** is the crucial link between you, the player, and the game's internal workings. It's responsible for:\n*   Listening to your input (like clicks).\n*   Translating your input into commands the game understands.\n*   Displaying the game's current state back to you.\n\nIt's like the game's friendly receptionist, ensuring smooth communication!\n\nNow that we understand how you interact with the game, let's dive into what you're actually interacting with: the game board itself.\n\n**Next Chapter**: Let's explore the [Board](02_board.md) and understand how it organizes the game's playing area.",
          "# Chapter 2: Board\n\nWelcome back! In our [previous chapter on the User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), we learned how you, the player, interact with our game. You click buttons, make moves, and the game shows you what's happening. But where do those moves actually *happen*? Where do the game pieces go?\n\nThat's where the **Board** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a physical board game like checkers or chess. You have a physical board with squares, and you place your pieces on those squares. The board is essential because it defines the playing area and holds the current state of the game (where all the pieces are).\n\nIn our digital game, we need a virtual version of that physical board. The `Board` abstraction is like the blueprint and container for our game's playing field. It's responsible for:\n\n1.  **Defining the playing area**: How big is the board? How many squares does it have?\n2.  **Holding the game pieces**: It keeps track of what's on each square.\n3.  **Allowing interaction**: It provides ways to place pieces, remove them, or check what's on a specific spot.\n\nWithout a `Board`, our game pieces would just float in digital space with nowhere to go!\n\n## The Board: A Grid of Possibilities\n\nAt its core, our `Board` is a grid. Think of it like a spreadsheet or a checkerboard. Each cell in that grid is a specific spot where a game piece can be placed. We call these individual spots **Squares**. We'll dive much deeper into [Squares in the next chapter](03_square.md), but for now, just know that the `Board` is made up of many `Square` objects.\n\nLet's look at a simple 3x3 board, like for Tic-Tac-Toe:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Board\n        A1[Square (0,0)] --- A2[Square (0,1)] --- A3[Square (0,2)]\n        B1[Square (1,0)] --- B2[Square (1,1)] --- B3[Square (1,2)]\n        C1[Square (2,0)] --- C2[Square (2,1)] --- C3[Square (2,2)]\n        A1 --- B1 --- C1\n        A2 --- B2 --- C2\n        A3 --- B3 --- C3\n    end\n```\n\nEach `Square` has a unique position (like coordinates `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, etc.) and can hold a game piece or be empty.\n\n## How to Use the Board\n\nLet's imagine we're building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. We'll need to:\n\n1.  **Create a new board**: Set up the playing field.\n2.  **Place a player's mark**: When a player makes a move, we need to update the board.\n3.  **Check a square**: See if a square is empty or occupied.\n\n### 1. Creating a Board\n\nWhen our game starts, one of the first things it does is create a `Board`. This usually involves telling the `Board` how big it should be.\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how you might create a board:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // Imagine this file exists\n\nfunction initializeGame() {\n  const gameBoard = new Board(3, 3); // Create a 3x3 board\n  console.log(\"Board created!\");\n  // ... rest of game setup\n  return gameBoard;\n}\n\nconst myGame = initializeGame();\n// Output: Board created!\n```\n\nIn this example, `new Board(3, 3)` tells the `Board` to set itself up with 3 rows and 3 columns. Internally, it will then create all the individual [Square](03_square.md) objects that make up this grid.\n\n### 2. Placing a Mark on the Board\n\nOnce the board is ready, players will make moves. When a player clicks on a spot (which the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects), the game needs to tell the `Board` to place a piece at that specific location.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists from above\n\nfunction playerMove(row: number, col: number, playerMark: string) {\n  const success = myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(row, col, playerMark);\n  if (success) {\n    console.log(`Placed ${playerMark} at (${row}, ${col})`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Cannot place at (${row}, ${col}). It might be occupied.`);\n  }\n}\n\nplayerMove(0, 0, 'X'); // Player 1 places 'X' at top-left\nplayerMove(1, 1, 'O'); // Player 2 places 'O' in the middle\n// Output:\n// Placed X at (0, 0)\n// Placed O at (1, 1)\n```\n\nThe `placeMark` method is how we update the `Board`'s state. It takes the row, column, and the player's mark (like 'X' or 'O') and tries to put it there.\n\n### 3. Checking a Square\n\nSometimes, the game needs to know what's on a particular square. For example, to check if a square is empty before placing a piece, or to see if a player has won by getting three of their marks in a row.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists and marks have been placed\n\nfunction checkSquareContent(row: number, col: number) {\n  const content = myGame.gameBoard.getMark(row, col);\n  console.log(`Content at (${row}, ${col}): ${content}`);\n}\n\ncheckSquareContent(0, 0); // Check the top-left square\ncheckSquareContent(0, 1); // Check an empty square\n// Output:\n// Content at (0, 0): X\n// Content at (0, 1): Empty\n```\n\nThe `getMark` method allows us to \"look\" at a square and see what's inside without changing anything.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Board Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to understand how the `Board` manages all these [Square](03_square.md) objects and their contents.\n\n### The Board's Internal Structure\n\nWhen you create a `Board`, it doesn't just magically appear. It needs to store all those [Square](03_square.md) objects. A common way to do this is using a 2D array (an array of arrays). Each element in this 2D array would be a reference to a `Square` object.\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\nimport { Square } from './square'; // We'll learn about Square in the next chapter!\n\nexport class Board {\n  private squares: Square[][]; // This will hold our grid of Square objects\n  private rows: number;\n  private cols: number;\n\n  constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n    this.rows = rows;\n    this.cols = cols;\n    this.squares = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n\n    // Loop to create all the individual Square objects\n    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n      this.squares[r] = []; // Create a new row\n      for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n        this.squares[r][c] = new Square(r, c); // Create a new Square for each spot\n      }\n    }\n    console.log(`Board initialized with ${rows * cols} squares.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like placeMark, getMark\n}\n```\n\nWhen `new Board(3, 3)` is called, the `constructor` method runs. It creates a `3x3` grid, and for each spot, it creates a brand new `Square` object, storing it in the `this.squares` array.\n\n### Placing a Mark: A Step-by-Step Process\n\nLet's trace what happens when you call `myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(0, 0, 'X')`:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game\n    participant Board as Board\n    participant Square as Square\n\n    UI->>Game: Player clicks (0,0)\n    Game->>Board: placeMark(0,0, 'X')\n    Board->>Board: Find Square at (0,0)\n    Board->>Square: setMark('X')\n    Square-->>Board: Mark set successfully\n    Board-->>Game: true (mark placed)\n    Game->>UI: Update display\n```\n\n1.  **User Interaction**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects that the player clicked on the top-left square.\n2.  **Game Logic**: The `Game` object (which we'll cover later) receives this input and decides it's a valid move. It then tells the `Board` to place an 'X' at `(0,0)`.\n3.  **Board Locates Square**: The `Board` uses the `(0,0)` coordinates to find the correct `Square` object within its `squares` grid.\n4.  **Square Updates Itself**: The `Board` then tells *that specific* `Square` object to `setMark('X')`. The `Square` checks if it's empty and, if so, updates its internal state to hold 'X'.\n5.  **Confirmation**: The `Square` confirms back to the `Board` that the mark was placed. The `Board` then confirms back to the `Game`.\n6.  **UI Update**: The `Game` tells the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to visually update the board, showing the 'X' in the top-left corner.\n\nHere's how the `placeMark` method might look inside the `Board` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\n// ... inside the Board class\n\n  placeMark(row: number, col: number, mark: string): boolean {\n    // Basic validation: check if coordinates are within board limits\n    if (row < 0 || row >= this.rows || col < 0 || col >= this.cols) {\n      console.error(\"Invalid board coordinates!\");\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    const targetSquare = this.squares[row][col]; // Get the specific Square object\n    return targetSquare.setMark(mark); // Ask the Square to set its mark\n  }\n```\n\nNotice how the `Board` doesn't directly store the 'X' or 'O'. Instead, it delegates that responsibility to the individual `Square` objects. This is a powerful concept in programming: breaking down a big problem (managing a whole board) into smaller, manageable pieces (managing individual squares).\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the `Board` abstraction, which is the digital playing field for our game. We learned:\n\n*   The `Board` defines the game's playing area and holds all the game pieces.\n*   It's essentially a grid made up of many individual [Square](03_square.md) objects.\n*   We can create a `Board`, place marks on it, and check the contents of its squares.\n*   Internally, the `Board` manages a 2D array of [Square](03_square.md) objects and delegates the task of holding marks to those individual squares.\n\nThe `Board` provides the structure, but what about the individual spots on the board? How do they know if they're empty or occupied? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we'll dive into the details of the **Square**!\n\n[Next Chapter: Square](03_square.md)",
          "# Chapter 3: Square\n\nWelcome back, aspiring game developers! In our [previous chapter on the Board](02_board.md), we learned that the `Board` is like the playing surface for our game. It's where all the action happens, holding the structure of our game world. But what exactly *makes up* that board?\n\nImagine a chessboard or a checkerboard. It's not just one big flat surface, right? It's divided into many individual spaces. Each of these spaces is distinct, has its own location, and can hold a game piece. In our game, these individual spaces are represented by the **Square** concept!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You have a 3x3 grid. When you make a move, you don't just say \"I'm putting an 'X' on the board.\" You say, \"I'm putting an 'X' in the *top-left square*\" or \"in the *middle-right square*.\"\n\nThe `Square` concept solves the problem of representing these individual, distinct locations on our [Board](02_board.md). Each `Square` knows:\n\n1.  **Where it is**: Its specific position on the board (like a row and column).\n2.  **What's on it**: Whether it's empty, or if a player's piece is currently occupying it.\n\nWithout `Square`s, our `Board` would just be a big, undifferentiated space, and we wouldn't know *where* to place pieces or *which* space a player is interacting with.\n\n## What is a Square?\n\nAt its core, a `Square` is a simple building block. It's like a single tile on a larger mosaic. Each `Square` object in our game holds just enough information to be useful:\n\n*   **Its Coordinates**: Where it lives on the [Board](02_board.md). We often use `row` and `column` numbers for this.\n*   **Its Current State**: What's currently occupying this `Square`? Is it empty, or does it hold a game piece?\n\nLet's look at a simplified idea of what a `Square` might look like in code:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual)\n\nclass Square {\n  row: number;       // Which row is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  column: number;    // Which column is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  content: any | null; // What's currently on this square? (e.g., a game piece, or null if empty)\n\n  constructor(row: number, column: number) {\n    this.row = row;\n    this.column = column;\n    this.content = null; // A new square starts empty\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods to check/set content ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when we create a `Square`, we tell it its `row` and `column`. Initially, its `content` is `null`, meaning it's empty.\n\n### How the Board Uses Squares\n\nThe [Board](02_board.md) doesn't just exist; it's made up of many `Square`s! Imagine the `Board` as a grid, and each cell in that grid is an instance of our `Square` class.\n\nWhen the [Board](02_board.md) is created, it creates all the `Square` objects it needs and arranges them. For example, a 3x3 board would create 9 `Square` objects.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Board] --> B[Square (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Square (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Square (0,2)]\n    A --> E[Square (1,0)]\n    A --> F[Square (1,1)]\n    A --> G[Square (1,2)]\n    A --> H[Square (2,0)]\n    A --> I[Square (2,1)]\n    A --> J[Square (2,2)]\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style I fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style J fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nThis diagram shows how a `Board` is composed of many individual `Square` objects, each with its own unique coordinates.\n\n## How to Interact with a Square\n\nAs a player, you don't directly interact with `Square` objects. Instead, you click on a visual representation of a square on your screen. The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) then translates that click into a request to the [Board](02_board.md), which then interacts with the specific `Square` object.\n\nLet's imagine we want to place a piece on a square.\n\n1.  **Check if it's empty**: Before placing a piece, we need to know if the `Square` is already occupied.\n2.  **Place a piece**: If it's empty, we can update the `Square`'s `content`.\n\nHere's how we might add simple methods to our `Square` class to do this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual - continued)\n\nclass Square {\n  // ... (row, column, content, constructor as above) ...\n\n  isEmpty(): boolean {\n    return this.content === null; // Is there nothing on this square?\n  }\n\n  placePiece(piece: any): void { // 'any' would be a specific game piece type\n    if (this.isEmpty()) {\n      this.content = piece; // Put the piece on the square\n      console.log(`Piece placed at (${this.row}, ${this.column})`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(`Square at (${this.row}, ${this.column}) is already occupied!`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  getPiece(): any | null {\n    return this.content; // What piece is on this square?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nLet's create a square and try to place a piece on it.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is happening inside the Board or Game logic\nconst mySquare = new Square(1, 1); // Create a square at row 1, column 1\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty? true\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"X\"); // Place an 'X' piece\n// Output: Piece placed at (1, 1)\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty now? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty now? false\n\nconsole.log(`What's on the square? ${mySquare.getPiece()}`);\n// Output: What's on the square? X\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"O\"); // Try to place another piece\n// Output: Square at (1, 1) is already occupied!\n```\n\nThis simple example shows how a `Square` object can manage its own state (what's on it) and provide methods to query or change that state.\n\n## How it Works Internally: A Player's Move\n\nLet's trace a simple interaction: a player clicks on an empty square to place their piece.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Board\n    participant Square\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on screen at (x,y)\n    UI->>Board: \"Player wants to place piece at (row, col)\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Hey Square (row, col), are you empty?\"\n    Square-->>Board: \"Yes, I am empty!\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Great! Place Player's piece on yourself.\"\n    Square->>Square: Updates its 'content' property\n    Square-->>Board: \"Piece placed!\"\n    Board-->>UI: \"Move successful!\"\n    UI->>Player: Updates screen to show new piece\n```\n\n1.  **Player Clicks**: You, the `Player`, click on a visual square on the screen.\n2.  **UI Notifies Board**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click and figures out which `row` and `column` on the game board corresponds to that click. It then tells the `Board` that the player wants to make a move at that specific location.\n3.  **Board Consults Square**: The `Board` then finds the correct `Square` object at the given `row` and `column` from its collection of squares. It asks that `Square`, \"Are you currently empty?\"\n4.  **Square Responds**: The `Square` checks its `content` property. If `content` is `null`, it reports back to the `Board` that it's empty.\n5.  **Board Instructs Square**: Since the `Square` is empty, the `Board` tells the `Square` to `placePiece()` on itself, passing the player's piece.\n6.  **Square Updates**: The `Square` updates its internal `content` property to now hold the player's piece.\n7.  **Success Notification**: The `Square` confirms the piece is placed, the `Board` confirms the move, and the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) updates the visual display for the `Player`.\n\nThis flow shows how the `Square` is a crucial, self-contained unit that manages its own small piece of the game state, allowing the `Board` to coordinate larger game logic.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `Square` concept, understanding it as the fundamental building block of our game [Board](02_board.md). We learned that each `Square` knows its position (row and column) and what content it holds (or if it's empty). We saw how simple methods allow us to check and modify a `Square`'s state, and how the `Board` relies on `Square`s to manage the game's physical layout.\n\nThe `Square` is a small but mighty component, essential for defining the spaces where our game pieces will reside and where players will interact.\n\nNow that we understand the individual `Square`s and how they form the `Board`, it's time to bring everything together and see how the entire **Game** operates!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game](04_game.md)",
          "# Chapter 4: Game\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've explored the foundational elements of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), which lets you interact with the game. Then, we moved to the [Board](02_board.md), the playing surface, and finally, we zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board.\n\nBut what brings all these pieces together? How do we go from a collection of squares to an actual *game* that you can play? That's where the **Game** abstraction comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're directing a play. You have the stage (`Board`), the individual props (`Square`s), and soon, we'll have the actors (`Player`s). But who tells everyone what to do? Who sets up the stage before the show, tells the actors when to enter, and makes sure the play follows its script?\n\nThat's the role of the `Game`! It's the **main director** or **orchestrator** of our entire game system. Its job is to:\n\n1.  **Set up the stage**: Create the [Board](02_board.md) and prepare it for play.\n2.  **Gather the actors**: Create the [Player](05_player.md)s who will participate.\n3.  **Start the show**: Kick off the game and manage its overall flow from beginning to end.\n4.  **Keep track of the big picture**: Know whose turn it is, if the game is over, and what the current situation is.\n\nWithout `Game`, we'd just have a bunch of disconnected parts. `Game` is what transforms those parts into a playable experience.\n\n## The Director's Role: Key Responsibilities of `Game`\n\nLet's break down the main things our `Game` director is responsible for:\n\n### 1. Initialization: Setting Up the Scene\n\nBefore any action can happen, the `Game` needs to set everything up. This means:\n\n*   Creating a new [Board](02_board.md) instance.\n*   Creating the necessary [Player](05_player.md) instances (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2).\n*   Placing initial game pieces or setting up the board according to the game's rules.\n\n### 2. Orchestration: Guiding the Flow\n\nOnce everything is set up, the `Game` is responsible for guiding the overall flow. While a separate [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) will handle the detailed turn-by-turn logic, the `Game` is the one that *starts* that process and knows when the game has reached its conclusion.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start Game] --> B{Game Initialization};\n    B --> C[Create Board];\n    C --> D[Create Players];\n    D --> E[Place Initial Pieces];\n    E --> F[Begin Game Loop / Turns];\n    F --> G{Game Over?};\n    G -- No --> F;\n    G -- Yes --> H[End Game];\n```\n\nThis diagram shows the high-level flow that the `Game` manages.\n\n## How to Start a New Game\n\nTo get our game running, we simply need to create an instance of our `Game` and tell it to `start()`.\n\nHere's how you might do it in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// src/main.ts (simplified)\nimport { Game } from './game'; // Imagine 'game.ts' exists\n\nexport class App {\n  start() {\n    console.log('Starting the application...');\n\n    // 1. Create a new Game instance\n    const myGame = new Game();\n\n    // 2. Tell the game to start!\n    myGame.start();\n\n    console.log('Game has been initialized and started!');\n  }\n}\n\n// To run this, you'd typically create an App instance and call start()\n// const app = new App();\n// app.start();\n```\n\n**What happens when `myGame.start()` is called?**\n\nWhen you call `start()` on a `Game` object, it kicks off the entire game setup process. You won't see immediate visual output from this tiny snippet, but behind the scenes, the `Game` is busy creating the [Board](02_board.md), setting up [Player](05_player.md)s, and getting ready for the first move. It's like the director shouting \"Action!\"\n\n## Under the Hood: How `Game` Works Internally\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain and see what our `Game` director does when you call `start()`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n\nWhen `game.start()` is called, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n1.  The `App` (our main application entry point) tells the `Game` to `start()`.\n2.  The `Game` first creates a new [Board](02_board.md). This board will be the playing field.\n3.  Next, the `Game` creates the necessary [Player](05_player.md) objects.\n4.  The `Game` then tells the newly created [Board](02_board.md) to set itself up, perhaps by placing initial game pieces on specific [Square](03_square.md)s.\n5.  Finally, the `Game` might inform the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) that the game has started and it's time to display the initial board state to the player. It then hands over control to the [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) to manage the actual turns.\n\nHere's a sequence diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as App\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Board\n    participant P as Player\n    participant U as UI Handler\n\n    A->G: start()\n    G->B: new Board()\n    G->P: new Player(1)\n    G->P: new Player(2)\n    G->B: initializeBoard(players)\n    B->>U: updateDisplay(initialState)\n    G->>G: (Hands over to Game State Machine)\n```\n\n### Diving into the Code\n\nLet's look at a simplified version of the `Game` class to see how it performs these steps.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // We'll learn about Board in Chapter 2\nimport { Player } from './player'; // We'll learn about Player in Chapter 5\nimport { UserInterfaceHandler } from './user_interface_handler'; // Chapter 1\n\nexport class Game {\n  private board: Board;\n  private players: Player[];\n  private uiHandler: UserInterfaceHandler;\n\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('Game: Initializing...');\n    this.uiHandler = new UserInterfaceHandler(); // Create UI handler\n    this.board = new Board(); // Create the Board\n    this.players = [\n      new Player('Player 1'), // Create Player 1\n      new Player('Player 2')  // Create Player 2\n    ];\n    console.log('Game: Board and Players created.');\n  }\n\n  start(): void {\n    console.log('Game: Starting the game!');\n    // Tell the board to set up its initial state\n    this.board.initialize(this.players);\n\n    // Tell the UI to display the initial board\n    this.uiHandler.displayBoard(this.board);\n\n    console.log('Game: Initial setup complete. Ready for turns!');\n    // In a real game, we'd now hand over to a Game State Machine\n    // to manage turns and game logic. (See Chapter 6!)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`constructor()`**: This special method runs automatically when you create a new `Game` object (`new Game()`). Inside, it's busy creating the essential components: a `UserInterfaceHandler`, a `Board`, and two `Player` objects. It's like the director preparing the stage and gathering the actors before the play even begins.\n*   **`start()`**: This method is called when you want the game to actually begin. It tells the `board` to `initialize()` itself (e.g., place pieces), and then tells the `uiHandler` to `displayBoard()` so you can see what's happening. After this, the game is ready for action!\n\nNotice how the `Game` class acts as a central hub, bringing together instances of `Board`, `Player`, and `UserInterfaceHandler`. It doesn't *do* everything itself, but it knows *who* needs to do what and when.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've met the **Game** abstraction, the central director of our entire game system. We learned that `Game` is responsible for:\n\n*   **Orchestrating** the entire game flow.\n*   **Initializing** the [Board](02_board.md) and [Player](05_player.md)s.\n*   **Starting** the game and preparing it for play.\n\nIt's the glue that holds all the other pieces together, transforming individual components into a cohesive, playable experience.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Game` sets up the stage and gets everything ready, it's time to introduce the stars of the show: the players! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the **Player** abstraction and understand their role in the game.\n\n[Next Chapter: Player](05_player.md)",
          "# Chapter 5: Player\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've built up the core physical components of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for interaction, then moved to the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing surface, and finally zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board. Most recently, in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md), we saw how the `Game` class brings all these pieces together to form a playable experience.\n\nBut who *plays* the game? Who makes the moves? Who owns the pieces on the [Board](02_board.md)? That's where the **Player** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two participants: one player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. The game needs to keep track of whose turn it is, which symbol belongs to which player, and eventually, who won.\n\nThe `Player` abstraction solves this problem by representing these participants in our game's code. It's like giving each person playing the game a unique identity within the software. Without a `Player` concept, the game wouldn't know who is making a move or whose turn it is, leading to a very confusing and unplayable experience!\n\n## What is a Player?\n\nAt its core, a `Player` is a simple concept: it's an entity that participates in the game. For our purposes, a `Player` needs a few key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Identity**: A way to distinguish one player from another. In Tic-Tac-Toe, this might be their symbol ('X' or 'O').\n2.  **Turn Management**: The game needs to know which `Player` is currently active and allowed to make a move.\n3.  **Ownership**: Players often \"own\" certain elements in the game, like their pieces on the [Board](02_board.md) or the [Square](03_square.md)s they've claimed.\n\nThink of a `Player` as a \"role\" in the game. Just like in a play, each actor has a role, and that role defines what they can do and what they represent. In our game, the `Player` role defines who is 'X' and who is 'O'.\n\n## How the Game Uses Players\n\nThe `Game` class (which we discussed in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) needs to know about the `Player`s to manage the game flow. For example, when it's time for a move, the `Game` will ask the *current* `Player` to make their move.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how a `Player` might be created and identified:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of setting up our game\nclass Player {\n  private symbol: string; // e.g., 'X' or 'O'\n\n  constructor(symbol: string) {\n    this.symbol = symbol;\n  }\n\n  getSymbol(): string {\n    return this.symbol;\n  }\n}\n\n// Creating two players for our game\nconst playerX = new Player('X');\nconst playerO = new Player('O');\n\nconsole.log(`Player 1 is: ${playerX.getSymbol()}`);\nconsole.log(`Player 2 is: ${playerO.getSymbol()}`);\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a `Player` class that can hold a `symbol` (like 'X' or 'O').\n*   When we create a new `Player` object, we give it its unique symbol.\n*   We can then ask the `Player` object what its symbol is using `getSymbol()`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nPlayer 1 is: X\nPlayer 2 is: O\n```\n\nThis simple setup allows the `Game` to keep track of who is who.\n\n## Inside the Player Abstraction\n\nSo, what happens \"under the hood\" when we talk about `Player`s in our game?\n\nWhen the game starts, the `Game` needs to set up the `Player`s. It creates instances of the `Player` class, giving each one its unique identifier (like 'X' or 'O'). Then, as the game progresses, the `Game` will interact with these `Player` objects to manage turns and actions.\n\nHere's a simple sequence of how the `Game` might interact with `Player`s to manage turns:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Game\n    participant PlayerX as Player 'X'\n    participant PlayerO as Player 'O'\n\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n    PlayerX-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerO: It's your turn!\n    PlayerO-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  The `Game` starts and tells `Player 'X'` that it's their turn.\n2.  `Player 'X'` performs an action (like placing their symbol on a [Square](03_square.md)).\n3.  Once `Player 'X'` is done, the `Game` then tells `Player 'O'` that it's their turn.\n4.  This cycle continues, with the `Game` orchestrating whose turn it is by communicating with the `Player` objects.\n\n### Player Code Structure\n\nWhile our `src/main.ts` file is currently very minimal, in a real game, you would likely have a dedicated file for the `Player` class. Let's imagine what that might look like:\n\n```typescript\n// src/player.ts (This is an imagined file for our Player class)\n\nexport class Player {\n  private id: string; // A unique identifier for the player, e.g., 'X', 'O', 'Player 1'\n\n  constructor(id: string) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n\n  // Returns the player's unique identifier\n  getId(): string {\n    return this.id;\n  }\n\n  // In a more complex game, a player might have a score,\n  // or a list of pieces they own. For now, we keep it simple.\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a class `Player` with a `private id` property. This `id` is what makes each player unique.\n*   The `constructor` sets this `id` when a new `Player` is created.\n*   The `getId()` method allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask who this player is.\n\nNow, let's see how the `Game` class might use these `Player` objects:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Simplified example, building on Chapter 4)\nimport { Player } from './player'; // Assuming Player is in its own file\n\nexport class Game {\n  private players: Player[]; // An array to hold all players\n  private currentPlayerIndex: number; // To track whose turn it is\n\n  constructor() {\n    // Initialize our players when the game starts\n    this.players = [new Player('X'), new Player('O')];\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = 0; // Start with the first player (Player 'X')\n    // ... other game setup like creating the Board\n  }\n\n  // Returns the Player object whose turn it currently is\n  getCurrentPlayer(): Player {\n    return this.players[this.currentPlayerIndex];\n  }\n\n  // Advances to the next player's turn\n  nextTurn(): void {\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = (this.currentPlayerIndex + 1) % this.players.length;\n    console.log(`It's now ${this.getCurrentPlayer().getId()}'s turn.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other game logic\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `Game` class now has a `players` array to store all the `Player` objects.\n*   `currentPlayerIndex` keeps track of which player in the array is currently active.\n*   `getCurrentPlayer()` lets any part of the game know who is currently playing.\n*   `nextTurn()` is a simple way to switch to the other player. The `%` (modulo) operator ensures we loop back to the first player after the last player has taken their turn.\n\nThis shows how the `Game` class acts as the manager, using the `Player` objects to keep track of the participants and whose turn it is.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've introduced the `Player` abstraction, which is crucial for any interactive game. We learned that a `Player` represents a participant in the game, providing them with an identity and allowing the game to manage turns and ownership. We saw how the `Game` class uses `Player` objects to keep track of who is playing and whose turn it is.\n\nUnderstanding the `Player` is key to building a dynamic and interactive game. But how does the game *know* what state it's in (e.g., \"X's turn,\" \"Game Over,\" \"X Wins\") and what actions are allowed at any given moment? That's what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into the **Game State Machine**!\n\n[Chapter 6: Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)",
          "# Chapter 6: Game State Machine\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! So far, we've assembled the core pieces of our game. We have the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for player interaction, the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing field, and individual [Square](03_square.md)s making up that board. We also have the overarching [Game](04_game.md) class that brings everything together, and the [Player](05_player.md)s who participate in the game.\n\nBut think about a game you play. It doesn't just *exist*. It goes through different phases, right? First, it might be \"waiting for players,\" then \"player 1's turn,\" then \"player 2's turn,\" and eventually \"game over.\" How do we manage these different phases and ensure the game behaves correctly at each stage?\n\nThat's where the **Game State Machine** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine a simple traffic light. It's not always green, or always red. It cycles through different \"states\": Red, Yellow, Green. And it only changes from Red to Green *after* Yellow, not directly. It follows a specific set of rules for changing states.\n\nOur game is similar! It needs to know what \"state\" it's currently in to decide what actions are allowed and what should happen next. For example:\n*   If it's \"Player 1's Turn,\" only Player 1 should be able to make a move.\n*   If the game is \"Over,\" no more moves should be allowed.\n*   If the game is \"Starting,\" we might need to set up the [Board](02_board.md) and assign [Player](05_player.md)s.\n\nWithout a `Game State Machine`, managing these different phases and rules can become very messy, with lots of `if/else` statements scattered throughout your code. The `Game State Machine` provides a clean, organized way to handle these different stages of your game.\n\n## Understanding Game States and Transitions\n\nThe `Game State Machine` is built on two main ideas:\n\n1.  **States:** These are the distinct phases or conditions your game can be in. Think of them as snapshots of your game's current situation.\n    *   Examples: `WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, `Player2Turn`, `GameOver`, `Paused`.\n2.  **Transitions:** These are the rules that define how your game moves from one state to another. A transition is usually triggered by an \"event.\"\n    *   Examples:\n        *   From `WaitingToStart` to `Player1Turn` (event: \"Game Started\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn` (event: \"Player 1 Made Valid Move\").\n        *   From `Player2Turn` to `GameOver` (event: \"Player 2 Won\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Paused` (event: \"Player Pressed Pause Button\").\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[WaitingToStart] -->|Game Started| B(Player1Turn)\n    B -->|Player 1 Made Move| C(Player2Turn)\n    C -->|Player 2 Made Move| B\n    B -->|Player 1 Won| D{GameOver}\n    C -->|Player 2 Won| D\n    B -->|Player Pressed Pause| E[Paused]\n    E -->|Player Pressed Resume| B\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   The boxes (`WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, etc.) are our **states**.\n*   The arrows are our **transitions**, and the text on the arrows describes the **events** that trigger them.\n\n## How the Game State Machine Works in Our Game\n\nThe `Game` class (from [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) will rely on the `Game State Machine` to know what's currently happening and what actions are allowed.\n\nLet's say a [Player](05_player.md) tries to make a move.\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click.\n2.  It tells the `Game` class about the attempted move.\n3.  The `Game` class then asks the `Game State Machine`: \"Is a move allowed in the current state, and if so, whose turn is it?\"\n4.  The `Game State Machine` checks its current state (e.g., `Player1Turn`). If it's `Player1Turn` and Player 1 made the move, it allows it and then tells the `Game` to update the [Board](02_board.md) and transition to `Player2Turn`.\n\n### Example: Changing Turns\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how the `Game` might interact with a `Game State Machine`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Conceptual)\n\nimport { GameStateMachine, GameState } from './gameStateMachine'; // Imagine this file exists\nimport { Player } from './player'; // From Chapter 5\n\nclass Game {\n  private stateMachine: GameStateMachine;\n  // ... other game properties like board, players\n\n  constructor(player1: Player, player2: Player) {\n    // ... initialize board, players\n    this.stateMachine = new GameStateMachine();\n    this.stateMachine.transition('GAME_STARTED'); // Initial transition\n  }\n\n  handlePlayerMove(player: Player, squareId: string): void {\n    // Check if the move is valid for the current game state\n    if (this.stateMachine.canTransition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE', player)) {\n      // Perform the move on the board (details from Chapter 2 & 3)\n      // ... logic to update the Board ...\n\n      // If move was successful, transition the game state\n      this.stateMachine.transition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE');\n\n      // Update UI to reflect new state (e.g., whose turn it is)\n      // this.uiHandler.updateTurnDisplay(this.stateMachine.getCurrentPlayer());\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Invalid move for current game state or player!\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... other game methods\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The `Game` class creates an instance of `GameStateMachine`.\n*   When the game starts, it tells the `stateMachine` to transition to the initial state (`GAME_STARTED`).\n*   When a player tries to move, the `Game` first asks the `stateMachine` if such a transition (`PLAYER_MADE_MOVE`) is allowed for the current player.\n*   If allowed, the `Game` performs the actual move and then tells the `stateMachine` to update its internal state, which might change whose turn it is.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Game State Machine Manages States\n\nLet's peek inside the `Game State Machine` itself. It needs to keep track of the current state and have rules for how to change it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Flow\n\nWhen an event happens (like a player making a move), here's how the `Game State Machine` helps manage the flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GSM as Game State Machine\n\n    UI->>G: Player clicked Square (e.g., \"A1\")\n    G->>GSM: Request: Can I process 'PLAYER_MOVE' event?\n    GSM-->>G: Response: Yes, current state is 'Player1Turn'.\n    G->>G: Process player move on Board\n    G->>GSM: Notify: 'PLAYER_MOVE' event occurred.\n    GSM->>GSM: Update current state to 'Player2Turn'.\n    GSM-->>G: Response: State updated to 'Player2Turn'.\n    G->>UI: Update UI (e.g., \"Player 2's Turn\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects a player's action and informs the `Game`.\n2.  The `Game` doesn't just blindly execute the action. It first consults the `Game State Machine` to ask, \"Is this action (`PLAYER_MOVE`) valid right now?\"\n3.  The `Game State Machine` checks its `currentState` (e.g., `Player1Turn`) and its internal rules. If the action is valid for that state, it responds \"Yes.\"\n4.  The `Game` then proceeds to perform the actual game logic (like placing a piece on the [Board](02_board.md)).\n5.  After the game logic is done, the `Game` tells the `Game State Machine` that the `PLAYER_MOVE` event has successfully occurred.\n6.  The `Game State Machine` then updates its `currentState` based on its rules (e.g., from `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn`).\n7.  Finally, the `Game` can tell the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to update what the player sees, reflecting the new game state.\n\n### Conceptual Code for Game State Machine\n\nThe `Game State Machine` itself might look something like this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameStateMachine.ts (Conceptual)\n\nexport enum GameState {\n  WaitingToStart = \"WAITING_TO_START\",\n  Player1Turn = \"PLAYER_1_TURN\",\n  Player2Turn = \"PLAYER_2_TURN\",\n  GameOver = \"GAME_OVER\",\n  Paused = \"PAUSED\",\n}\n\nexport class GameStateMachine {\n  private currentState: GameState;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.currentState = GameState.WaitingToStart; // Start here\n  }\n\n  getCurrentState(): GameState {\n    return this.currentState;\n  }\n\n  transition(event: string): void {\n    switch (this.currentState) {\n      case GameState.WaitingToStart:\n        if (event === 'GAME_STARTED') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player1Turn;\n          console.log(\"Game started! It's Player 1's turn.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      case GameState.Player1Turn:\n        if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE') {\n          // Check for win/draw conditions here in a real game\n          // For simplicity, let's just switch turns\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player2Turn;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 moved. It's Player 2's turn.\");\n        } else if (event === 'PLAYER_WON') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.GameOver;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 won! Game Over.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      // ... cases for Player2Turn, GameOver, Paused\n      default:\n        console.log(`Event '${event}' not handled in state ${this.currentState}`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // A method to check if a transition is allowed *before* making it\n  canTransition(event: string, player?: any): boolean {\n    // This would contain more complex logic in a real game\n    // For example, checking if 'player' matches the current turn\n    if (this.currentState === GameState.GameOver) return false;\n    if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE' && \n        (this.currentState === GameState.Player1Turn || this.currentState === GameState.Player2Turn)) {\n        // In a real game, check if 'player' is the current player\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   We define an `enum` called `GameState` to clearly list all possible states.\n*   The `GameStateMachine` class holds the `currentState`.\n*   The `transition` method is the heart of it. When an `event` occurs, it uses a `switch` statement to check the `currentState` and then decides if and how to change to a `nextState`.\n*   The `canTransition` method is a helper that allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask if a certain action is valid *before* trying to perform it. This helps prevent illegal moves.\n\nThis structured approach makes your game logic much easier to understand, maintain, and extend. If you want to add a \"Pause\" state, you just add it to the `GameState` enum and update the `transition` logic in one place.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the **Game State Machine**, a powerful concept for managing the different phases and behaviors of our game. We learned that:\n*   Games go through distinct **states** (like `Player1Turn` or `GameOver`).\n*   **Events** trigger **transitions** between these states according to defined rules.\n*   The `Game State Machine` provides a centralized and organized way for the `Game` class to manage its flow, ensuring that actions are only performed when appropriate for the current game phase.\n\nWith the `Game State Machine`, our game can now intelligently respond to player actions and progress through its lifecycle in a predictable and robust way. We've now covered all the core components of our game's architecture!"

          "# Chapter 1: User Interface Handler\n\nWelcome to the exciting world of game development! In this series, we'll explore the different parts that make up our game, starting with how you, the player, interact with it.\n\nImagine you're playing a game on your computer or phone. How do you tell the game what you want to do? How does the game show you what's happening? That's where the **User Interface Handler** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a simple board game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You need to:\n1.  **See the board**: Where are the X's and O's?\n2.  **Make a move**: Click on an empty square to place your mark.\n3.  **See the result**: Did your move work? Did you win?\n\nWithout a way to do these things, the game would just run by itself, and you couldn't play! The **User Interface Handler** is like the game's eyes and ears, and its mouth. It listens to your actions, translates them for the game's brain, and then shows you what the game's brain decides.\n\n**Our Goal for this Chapter**: Understand how the User Interface Handler acts as the bridge between you and the game, allowing you to click a square and see the game respond.\n\n## The User Interface Handler: Your Game's Best Friend\n\nLet's break down what the User Interface Handler does:\n\n1.  **It Listens to You (Input)**: It constantly watches for your clicks, key presses, or touches. It's like a very attentive waiter waiting for your order.\n2.  **It Shows You Things (Output)**: It's responsible for drawing the game board, showing messages, displaying scores, and generally making sure you can see everything important. This is like the waiter bringing your food and drinks.\n3.  **It Translates Your Actions**: When you click a square, the User Interface Handler doesn't just send \"click!\" to the game. It translates that into something meaningful, like \"Player wants to place a mark on square number 5.\"\n\n## How You \"Use\" the User Interface Handler\n\nAs a player, you don't directly \"call\" the User Interface Handler. Instead, it's always running in the background, ready to react to your actions.\n\nLet's consider our main use case: **Clicking a square on the game board to make a move.**\n\nWhen you click a square on your screen:\n*   The User Interface Handler \"catches\" that click.\n*   It figures out *which* square you clicked.\n*   It then tells the main game logic, \"Hey, the player wants to interact with square (X, Y)!\"\n*   After the game processes your move, the User Interface Handler updates the screen to show the new state of the [Board](02_board.md).\n\nHere's a very simplified idea of what might happen when you click:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of our User Interface Handler\nclass UserInterfaceHandler {\n    // ... other parts of the handler ...\n\n    // This method is called when a player clicks on a visual square\n    handleSquareClick(squareId: string) {\n        console.log(`Player clicked square: ${squareId}`);\n        // In a real game, this would tell the main Game logic\n        // For example: game.makeMove(squareId);\n        // We'll learn more about the Game logic in [Game](04_game.md)!\n    }\n\n    // This method updates what the player sees on the screen\n    updateDisplay(boardData: any) {\n        console.log(\"Updating the game board display...\");\n        // This is where the UI Handler would draw the X's and O's\n        // on the screen based on the latest boardData.\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation**: The `handleSquareClick` method is like the UI Handler noticing you've pointed at something specific. It then logs which `squareId` was clicked. The `updateDisplay` method is how the UI Handler shows you the latest game situation, like drawing an 'X' on the board after a move.\n\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the User Interface Handler connects everything.\n\nThink of the User Interface Handler as a friendly receptionist at a busy hotel.\n\n*   **You (the Player)**: You walk up to the front desk.\n*   **Receptionist (User Interface Handler)**: Greets you and asks what you need.\n*   **Hotel Manager (Game Logic)**: The person who knows all the rules and makes decisions.\n*   **Room Status Board (Game Board)**: Shows which rooms are occupied.\n\nHere's how your request to \"check into a room\" (make a move) might flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UIHandler as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game Logic\n    participant Board as Game Board\n    \n    Player->>UIHandler: Clicks a Square (e.g., \"Square 3\")\n    UIHandler->>Game: Notify: \"Player wants to move on Square 3\"\n    Game->>Game: Process move (e.g., check rules, update Player, Board)\n    Game->>UIHandler: Request: \"Update display with new Board state\"\n    UIHandler->>Board: Get current state of all Squares\n    Board-->>UIHandler: Current Board data (e.g., \"Square 3 now has 'X'\")\n    UIHandler->>Player: Display updated Board on screen\n```\n\n**Step-by-step explanation of the diagram:**\n\n1.  **Player Clicks a Square**: You, the player, click on a visual representation of a [Square](03_square.md) on your screen.\n2.  **UI Handler Notifies Game**: The `User Interface Handler` detects this click. It translates your click into a meaningful message, like \"Player wants to make a move on Square 3,\" and sends it to the main `Game Logic`.\n3.  **Game Processes Move**: The `Game Logic` (which we'll explore in [Game](04_game.md) and [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)) takes this request. It checks if the move is valid, updates the internal game state, and might update the [Player](05_player.md) or the [Board](02_board.md).\n4.  **Game Requests Display Update**: Once the `Game Logic` has finished processing, it tells the `User Interface Handler`, \"Hey, the game state has changed! Please show the player the new situation.\"\n5.  **UI Handler Gets Board State**: The `User Interface Handler` then asks the [Board](02_board.md) for its current data (e.g., which [Square](03_square.md)s have X's, which have O's).\n6.  **Board Provides Data**: The [Board](02_board.md) sends back the information about its current state.\n7.  **UI Handler Displays Updated Board**: Finally, the `User Interface Handler` uses this data to redraw the game board on your screen, showing you the result of your move!\n\nThis entire cycle happens very quickly, making it feel like the game responds instantly to your actions.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we learned that the **User Interface Handler** is the crucial link between you, the player, and the game's internal workings. It's responsible for:\n*   Listening to your input (like clicks).\n*   Translating your input into commands the game understands.\n*   Displaying the game's current state back to you.\n\nIt's like the game's friendly receptionist, ensuring smooth communication!\n\nNow that we understand how you interact with the game, let's dive into what you're actually interacting with: the game board itself.\n\n**Next Chapter**: Let's explore the [Board](02_board.md) and understand how it organizes the game's playing area.",
          "# Chapter 2: Board\n\nWelcome back! In our [previous chapter on the User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), we learned how you, the player, interact with our game. You click buttons, make moves, and the game shows you what's happening. But where do those moves actually *happen*? Where do the game pieces go?\n\nThat's where the **Board** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a physical board game like checkers or chess. You have a physical board with squares, and you place your pieces on those squares. The board is essential because it defines the playing area and holds the current state of the game (where all the pieces are).\n\nIn our digital game, we need a virtual version of that physical board. The `Board` abstraction is like the blueprint and container for our game's playing field. It's responsible for:\n\n1.  **Defining the playing area**: How big is the board? How many squares does it have?\n2.  **Holding the game pieces**: It keeps track of what's on each square.\n3.  **Allowing interaction**: It provides ways to place pieces, remove them, or check what's on a specific spot.\n\nWithout a `Board`, our game pieces would just float in digital space with nowhere to go!\n\n## The Board: A Grid of Possibilities\n\nAt its core, our `Board` is a grid. Think of it like a spreadsheet or a checkerboard. Each cell in that grid is a specific spot where a game piece can be placed. We call these individual spots **Squares**. We'll dive much deeper into [Squares in the next chapter](03_square.md), but for now, just know that the `Board` is made up of many `Square` objects.\n\nLet's look at a simple 3x3 board, like for Tic-Tac-Toe:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Board\n        A1[Square (0,0)] --- A2[Square (0,1)] --- A3[Square (0,2)]\n        B1[Square (1,0)] --- B2[Square (1,1)] --- B3[Square (1,2)]\n        C1[Square (2,0)] --- C2[Square (2,1)] --- C3[Square (2,2)]\n        A1 --- B1 --- C1\n        A2 --- B2 --- C2\n        A3 --- B3 --- C3\n    end\n```\n\nEach `Square` has a unique position (like coordinates `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, etc.) and can hold a game piece or be empty.\n\n## How to Use the Board\n\nLet's imagine we're building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. We'll need to:\n\n1.  **Create a new board**: Set up the playing field.\n2.  **Place a player's mark**: When a player makes a move, we need to update the board.\n3.  **Check a square**: See if a square is empty or occupied.\n\n### 1. Creating a Board\n\nWhen our game starts, one of the first things it does is create a `Board`. This usually involves telling the `Board` how big it should be.\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how you might create a board:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // Imagine this file exists\n\nfunction initializeGame() {\n  const gameBoard = new Board(3, 3); // Create a 3x3 board\n  console.log(\"Board created!\");\n  // ... rest of game setup\n  return gameBoard;\n}\n\nconst myGame = initializeGame();\n// Output: Board created!\n```\n\nIn this example, `new Board(3, 3)` tells the `Board` to set itself up with 3 rows and 3 columns. Internally, it will then create all the individual [Square](03_square.md) objects that make up this grid.\n\n### 2. Placing a Mark on the Board\n\nOnce the board is ready, players will make moves. When a player clicks on a spot (which the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects), the game needs to tell the `Board` to place a piece at that specific location.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists from above\n\nfunction playerMove(row: number, col: number, playerMark: string) {\n  const success = myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(row, col, playerMark);\n  if (success) {\n    console.log(`Placed ${playerMark} at (${row}, ${col})`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Cannot place at (${row}, ${col}). It might be occupied.`);\n  }\n}\n\nplayerMove(0, 0, 'X'); // Player 1 places 'X' at top-left\nplayerMove(1, 1, 'O'); // Player 2 places 'O' in the middle\n// Output:\n// Placed X at (0, 0)\n// Placed O at (1, 1)\n```\n\nThe `placeMark` method is how we update the `Board`'s state. It takes the row, column, and the player's mark (like 'X' or 'O') and tries to put it there.\n\n### 3. Checking a Square\n\nSometimes, the game needs to know what's on a particular square. For example, to check if a square is empty before placing a piece, or to see if a player has won by getting three of their marks in a row.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists and marks have been placed\n\nfunction checkSquareContent(row: number, col: number) {\n  const content = myGame.gameBoard.getMark(row, col);\n  console.log(`Content at (${row}, ${col}): ${content}`);\n}\n\ncheckSquareContent(0, 0); // Check the top-left square\ncheckSquareContent(0, 1); // Check an empty square\n// Output:\n// Content at (0, 0): X\n// Content at (0, 1): Empty\n```\n\nThe `getMark` method allows us to \"look\" at a square and see what's inside without changing anything.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Board Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to understand how the `Board` manages all these [Square](03_square.md) objects and their contents.\n\n### The Board's Internal Structure\n\nWhen you create a `Board`, it doesn't just magically appear. It needs to store all those [Square](03_square.md) objects. A common way to do this is using a 2D array (an array of arrays). Each element in this 2D array would be a reference to a `Square` object.\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\nimport { Square } from './square'; // We'll learn about Square in the next chapter!\n\nexport class Board {\n  private squares: Square[][]; // This will hold our grid of Square objects\n  private rows: number;\n  private cols: number;\n\n  constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n    this.rows = rows;\n    this.cols = cols;\n    this.squares = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n\n    // Loop to create all the individual Square objects\n    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n      this.squares[r] = []; // Create a new row\n      for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n        this.squares[r][c] = new Square(r, c); // Create a new Square for each spot\n      }\n    }\n    console.log(`Board initialized with ${rows * cols} squares.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like placeMark, getMark\n}\n```\n\nWhen `new Board(3, 3)` is called, the `constructor` method runs. It creates a `3x3` grid, and for each spot, it creates a brand new `Square` object, storing it in the `this.squares` array.\n\n### Placing a Mark: A Step-by-Step Process\n\nLet's trace what happens when you call `myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(0, 0, 'X')`:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game\n    participant Board as Board\n    participant Square as Square\n\n    UI->>Game: Player clicks (0,0)\n    Game->>Board: placeMark(0,0, 'X')\n    Board->>Board: Find Square at (0,0)\n    Board->>Square: setMark('X')\n    Square-->>Board: Mark set successfully\n    Board-->>Game: true (mark placed)\n    Game->>UI: Update display\n```\n\n1.  **User Interaction**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects that the player clicked on the top-left square.\n2.  **Game Logic**: The `Game` object (which we'll cover later) receives this input and decides it's a valid move. It then tells the `Board` to place an 'X' at `(0,0)`.\n3.  **Board Locates Square**: The `Board` uses the `(0,0)` coordinates to find the correct `Square` object within its `squares` grid.\n4.  **Square Updates Itself**: The `Board` then tells *that specific* `Square` object to `setMark('X')`. The `Square` checks if it's empty and, if so, updates its internal state to hold 'X'.\n5.  **Confirmation**: The `Square` confirms back to the `Board` that the mark was placed. The `Board` then confirms back to the `Game`.\n6.  **UI Update**: The `Game` tells the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to visually update the board, showing the 'X' in the top-left corner.\n\nHere's how the `placeMark` method might look inside the `Board` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\n// ... inside the Board class\n\n  placeMark(row: number, col: number, mark: string): boolean {\n    // Basic validation: check if coordinates are within board limits\n    if (row < 0 || row >= this.rows || col < 0 || col >= this.cols) {\n      console.error(\"Invalid board coordinates!\");\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    const targetSquare = this.squares[row][col]; // Get the specific Square object\n    return targetSquare.setMark(mark); // Ask the Square to set its mark\n  }\n```\n\nNotice how the `Board` doesn't directly store the 'X' or 'O'. Instead, it delegates that responsibility to the individual `Square` objects. This is a powerful concept in programming: breaking down a big problem (managing a whole board) into smaller, manageable pieces (managing individual squares).\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the `Board` abstraction, which is the digital playing field for our game. We learned:\n\n*   The `Board` defines the game's playing area and holds all the game pieces.\n*   It's essentially a grid made up of many individual [Square](03_square.md) objects.\n*   We can create a `Board`, place marks on it, and check the contents of its squares.\n*   Internally, the `Board` manages a 2D array of [Square](03_square.md) objects and delegates the task of holding marks to those individual squares.\n\nThe `Board` provides the structure, but what about the individual spots on the board? How do they know if they're empty or occupied? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we'll dive into the details of the **Square**!\n\n[Next Chapter: Square](03_square.md)",
          "# Chapter 3: Square\n\nWelcome back, aspiring game developers! In our [previous chapter on the Board](02_board.md), we learned that the `Board` is like the playing surface for our game. It's where all the action happens, holding the structure of our game world. But what exactly *makes up* that board?\n\nImagine a chessboard or a checkerboard. It's not just one big flat surface, right? It's divided into many individual spaces. Each of these spaces is distinct, has its own location, and can hold a game piece. In our game, these individual spaces are represented by the **Square** concept!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You have a 3x3 grid. When you make a move, you don't just say \"I'm putting an 'X' on the board.\" You say, \"I'm putting an 'X' in the *top-left square*\" or \"in the *middle-right square*.\"\n\nThe `Square` concept solves the problem of representing these individual, distinct locations on our [Board](02_board.md). Each `Square` knows:\n\n1.  **Where it is**: Its specific position on the board (like a row and column).\n2.  **What's on it**: Whether it's empty, or if a player's piece is currently occupying it.\n\nWithout `Square`s, our `Board` would just be a big, undifferentiated space, and we wouldn't know *where* to place pieces or *which* space a player is interacting with.\n\n## What is a Square?\n\nAt its core, a `Square` is a simple building block. It's like a single tile on a larger mosaic. Each `Square` object in our game holds just enough information to be useful:\n\n*   **Its Coordinates**: Where it lives on the [Board](02_board.md). We often use `row` and `column` numbers for this.\n*   **Its Current State**: What's currently occupying this `Square`? Is it empty, or does it hold a game piece?\n\nLet's look at a simplified idea of what a `Square` might look like in code:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual)\n\nclass Square {\n  row: number;       // Which row is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  column: number;    // Which column is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  content: any | null; // What's currently on this square? (e.g., a game piece, or null if empty)\n\n  constructor(row: number, column: number) {\n    this.row = row;\n    this.column = column;\n    this.content = null; // A new square starts empty\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods to check/set content ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when we create a `Square`, we tell it its `row` and `column`. Initially, its `content` is `null`, meaning it's empty.\n\n### How the Board Uses Squares\n\nThe [Board](02_board.md) doesn't just exist; it's made up of many `Square`s! Imagine the `Board` as a grid, and each cell in that grid is an instance of our `Square` class.\n\nWhen the [Board](02_board.md) is created, it creates all the `Square` objects it needs and arranges them. For example, a 3x3 board would create 9 `Square` objects.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Board] --> B[Square (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Square (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Square (0,2)]\n    A --> E[Square (1,0)]\n    A --> F[Square (1,1)]\n    A --> G[Square (1,2)]\n    A --> H[Square (2,0)]\n    A --> I[Square (2,1)]\n    A --> J[Square (2,2)]\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style I fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style J fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nThis diagram shows how a `Board` is composed of many individual `Square` objects, each with its own unique coordinates.\n\n## How to Interact with a Square\n\nAs a player, you don't directly interact with `Square` objects. Instead, you click on a visual representation of a square on your screen. The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) then translates that click into a request to the [Board](02_board.md), which then interacts with the specific `Square` object.\n\nLet's imagine we want to place a piece on a square.\n\n1.  **Check if it's empty**: Before placing a piece, we need to know if the `Square` is already occupied.\n2.  **Place a piece**: If it's empty, we can update the `Square`'s `content`.\n\nHere's how we might add simple methods to our `Square` class to do this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual - continued)\n\nclass Square {\n  // ... (row, column, content, constructor as above) ...\n\n  isEmpty(): boolean {\n    return this.content === null; // Is there nothing on this square?\n  }\n\n  placePiece(piece: any): void { // 'any' would be a specific game piece type\n    if (this.isEmpty()) {\n      this.content = piece; // Put the piece on the square\n      console.log(`Piece placed at (${this.row}, ${this.column})`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(`Square at (${this.row}, ${this.column}) is already occupied!`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  getPiece(): any | null {\n    return this.content; // What piece is on this square?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nLet's create a square and try to place a piece on it.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is happening inside the Board or Game logic\nconst mySquare = new Square(1, 1); // Create a square at row 1, column 1\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty? true\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"X\"); // Place an 'X' piece\n// Output: Piece placed at (1, 1)\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty now? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty now? false\n\nconsole.log(`What's on the square? ${mySquare.getPiece()}`);\n// Output: What's on the square? X\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"O\"); // Try to place another piece\n// Output: Square at (1, 1) is already occupied!\n```\n\nThis simple example shows how a `Square` object can manage its own state (what's on it) and provide methods to query or change that state.\n\n## How it Works Internally: A Player's Move\n\nLet's trace a simple interaction: a player clicks on an empty square to place their piece.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Board\n    participant Square\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on screen at (x,y)\n    UI->>Board: \"Player wants to place piece at (row, col)\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Hey Square (row, col), are you empty?\"\n    Square-->>Board: \"Yes, I am empty!\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Great! Place Player's piece on yourself.\"\n    Square->>Square: Updates its 'content' property\n    Square-->>Board: \"Piece placed!\"\n    Board-->>UI: \"Move successful!\"\n    UI->>Player: Updates screen to show new piece\n```\n\n1.  **Player Clicks**: You, the `Player`, click on a visual square on the screen.\n2.  **UI Notifies Board**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click and figures out which `row` and `column` on the game board corresponds to that click. It then tells the `Board` that the player wants to make a move at that specific location.\n3.  **Board Consults Square**: The `Board` then finds the correct `Square` object at the given `row` and `column` from its collection of squares. It asks that `Square`, \"Are you currently empty?\"\n4.  **Square Responds**: The `Square` checks its `content` property. If `content` is `null`, it reports back to the `Board` that it's empty.\n5.  **Board Instructs Square**: Since the `Square` is empty, the `Board` tells the `Square` to `placePiece()` on itself, passing the player's piece.\n6.  **Square Updates**: The `Square` updates its internal `content` property to now hold the player's piece.\n7.  **Success Notification**: The `Square` confirms the piece is placed, the `Board` confirms the move, and the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) updates the visual display for the `Player`.\n\nThis flow shows how the `Square` is a crucial, self-contained unit that manages its own small piece of the game state, allowing the `Board` to coordinate larger game logic.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `Square` concept, understanding it as the fundamental building block of our game [Board](02_board.md). We learned that each `Square` knows its position (row and column) and what content it holds (or if it's empty). We saw how simple methods allow us to check and modify a `Square`'s state, and how the `Board` relies on `Square`s to manage the game's physical layout.\n\nThe `Square` is a small but mighty component, essential for defining the spaces where our game pieces will reside and where players will interact.\n\nNow that we understand the individual `Square`s and how they form the `Board`, it's time to bring everything together and see how the entire **Game** operates!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game](04_game.md)",
          "# Chapter 4: Game\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've explored the foundational elements of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), which lets you interact with the game. Then, we moved to the [Board](02_board.md), the playing surface, and finally, we zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board.\n\nBut what brings all these pieces together? How do we go from a collection of squares to an actual *game* that you can play? That's where the **Game** abstraction comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're directing a play. You have the stage (`Board`), the individual props (`Square`s), and soon, we'll have the actors (`Player`s). But who tells everyone what to do? Who sets up the stage before the show, tells the actors when to enter, and makes sure the play follows its script?\n\nThat's the role of the `Game`! It's the **main director** or **orchestrator** of our entire game system. Its job is to:\n\n1.  **Set up the stage**: Create the [Board](02_board.md) and prepare it for play.\n2.  **Gather the actors**: Create the [Player](05_player.md)s who will participate.\n3.  **Start the show**: Kick off the game and manage its overall flow from beginning to end.\n4.  **Keep track of the big picture**: Know whose turn it is, if the game is over, and what the current situation is.\n\nWithout `Game`, we'd just have a bunch of disconnected parts. `Game` is what transforms those parts into a playable experience.\n\n## The Director's Role: Key Responsibilities of `Game`\n\nLet's break down the main things our `Game` director is responsible for:\n\n### 1. Initialization: Setting Up the Scene\n\nBefore any action can happen, the `Game` needs to set everything up. This means:\n\n*   Creating a new [Board](02_board.md) instance.\n*   Creating the necessary [Player](05_player.md) instances (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2).\n*   Placing initial game pieces or setting up the board according to the game's rules.\n\n### 2. Orchestration: Guiding the Flow\n\nOnce everything is set up, the `Game` is responsible for guiding the overall flow. While a separate [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) will handle the detailed turn-by-turn logic, the `Game` is the one that *starts* that process and knows when the game has reached its conclusion.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start Game] --> B{Game Initialization};\n    B --> C[Create Board];\n    C --> D[Create Players];\n    D --> E[Place Initial Pieces];\n    E --> F[Begin Game Loop / Turns];\n    F --> G{Game Over?};\n    G -- No --> F;\n    G -- Yes --> H[End Game];\n```\n\nThis diagram shows the high-level flow that the `Game` manages.\n\n## How to Start a New Game\n\nTo get our game running, we simply need to create an instance of our `Game` and tell it to `start()`.\n\nHere's how you might do it in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// src/main.ts (simplified)\nimport { Game } from './game'; // Imagine 'game.ts' exists\n\nexport class App {\n  start() {\n    console.log('Starting the application...');\n\n    // 1. Create a new Game instance\n    const myGame = new Game();\n\n    // 2. Tell the game to start!\n    myGame.start();\n\n    console.log('Game has been initialized and started!');\n  }\n}\n\n// To run this, you'd typically create an App instance and call start()\n// const app = new App();\n// app.start();\n```\n\n**What happens when `myGame.start()` is called?**\n\nWhen you call `start()` on a `Game` object, it kicks off the entire game setup process. You won't see immediate visual output from this tiny snippet, but behind the scenes, the `Game` is busy creating the [Board](02_board.md), setting up [Player](05_player.md)s, and getting ready for the first move. It's like the director shouting \"Action!\"\n\n## Under the Hood: How `Game` Works Internally\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain and see what our `Game` director does when you call `start()`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n\nWhen `game.start()` is called, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n1.  The `App` (our main application entry point) tells the `Game` to `start()`.\n2.  The `Game` first creates a new [Board](02_board.md). This board will be the playing field.\n3.  Next, the `Game` creates the necessary [Player](05_player.md) objects.\n4.  The `Game` then tells the newly created [Board](02_board.md) to set itself up, perhaps by placing initial game pieces on specific [Square](03_square.md)s.\n5.  Finally, the `Game` might inform the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) that the game has started and it's time to display the initial board state to the player. It then hands over control to the [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) to manage the actual turns.\n\nHere's a sequence diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as App\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Board\n    participant P as Player\n    participant U as UI Handler\n\n    A->G: start()\n    G->B: new Board()\n    G->P: new Player(1)\n    G->P: new Player(2)\n    G->B: initializeBoard(players)\n    B->>U: updateDisplay(initialState)\n    G->>G: (Hands over to Game State Machine)\n```\n\n### Diving into the Code\n\nLet's look at a simplified version of the `Game` class to see how it performs these steps.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // We'll learn about Board in Chapter 2\nimport { Player } from './player'; // We'll learn about Player in Chapter 5\nimport { UserInterfaceHandler } from './user_interface_handler'; // Chapter 1\n\nexport class Game {\n  private board: Board;\n  private players: Player[];\n  private uiHandler: UserInterfaceHandler;\n\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('Game: Initializing...');\n    this.uiHandler = new UserInterfaceHandler(); // Create UI handler\n    this.board = new Board(); // Create the Board\n    this.players = [\n      new Player('Player 1'), // Create Player 1\n      new Player('Player 2')  // Create Player 2\n    ];\n    console.log('Game: Board and Players created.');\n  }\n\n  start(): void {\n    console.log('Game: Starting the game!');\n    // Tell the board to set up its initial state\n    this.board.initialize(this.players);\n\n    // Tell the UI to display the initial board\n    this.uiHandler.displayBoard(this.board);\n\n    console.log('Game: Initial setup complete. Ready for turns!');\n    // In a real game, we'd now hand over to a Game State Machine\n    // to manage turns and game logic. (See Chapter 6!)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`constructor()`**: This special method runs automatically when you create a new `Game` object (`new Game()`). Inside, it's busy creating the essential components: a `UserInterfaceHandler`, a `Board`, and two `Player` objects. It's like the director preparing the stage and gathering the actors before the play even begins.\n*   **`start()`**: This method is called when you want the game to actually begin. It tells the `board` to `initialize()` itself (e.g., place pieces), and then tells the `uiHandler` to `displayBoard()` so you can see what's happening. After this, the game is ready for action!\n\nNotice how the `Game` class acts as a central hub, bringing together instances of `Board`, `Player`, and `UserInterfaceHandler`. It doesn't *do* everything itself, but it knows *who* needs to do what and when.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've met the **Game** abstraction, the central director of our entire game system. We learned that `Game` is responsible for:\n\n*   **Orchestrating** the entire game flow.\n*   **Initializing** the [Board](02_board.md) and [Player](05_player.md)s.\n*   **Starting** the game and preparing it for play.\n\nIt's the glue that holds all the other pieces together, transforming individual components into a cohesive, playable experience.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Game` sets up the stage and gets everything ready, it's time to introduce the stars of the show: the players! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the **Player** abstraction and understand their role in the game.\n\n[Next Chapter: Player](05_player.md)",
          "# Chapter 5: Player\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've built up the core physical components of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for interaction, then moved to the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing surface, and finally zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board. Most recently, in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md), we saw how the `Game` class brings all these pieces together to form a playable experience.\n\nBut who *plays* the game? Who makes the moves? Who owns the pieces on the [Board](02_board.md)? That's where the **Player** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two participants: one player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. The game needs to keep track of whose turn it is, which symbol belongs to which player, and eventually, who won.\n\nThe `Player` abstraction solves this problem by representing these participants in our game's code. It's like giving each person playing the game a unique identity within the software. Without a `Player` concept, the game wouldn't know who is making a move or whose turn it is, leading to a very confusing and unplayable experience!\n\n## What is a Player?\n\nAt its core, a `Player` is a simple concept: it's an entity that participates in the game. For our purposes, a `Player` needs a few key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Identity**: A way to distinguish one player from another. In Tic-Tac-Toe, this might be their symbol ('X' or 'O').\n2.  **Turn Management**: The game needs to know which `Player` is currently active and allowed to make a move.\n3.  **Ownership**: Players often \"own\" certain elements in the game, like their pieces on the [Board](02_board.md) or the [Square](03_square.md)s they've claimed.\n\nThink of a `Player` as a \"role\" in the game. Just like in a play, each actor has a role, and that role defines what they can do and what they represent. In our game, the `Player` role defines who is 'X' and who is 'O'.\n\n## How the Game Uses Players\n\nThe `Game` class (which we discussed in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) needs to know about the `Player`s to manage the game flow. For example, when it's time for a move, the `Game` will ask the *current* `Player` to make their move.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how a `Player` might be created and identified:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of setting up our game\nclass Player {\n  private symbol: string; // e.g., 'X' or 'O'\n\n  constructor(symbol: string) {\n    this.symbol = symbol;\n  }\n\n  getSymbol(): string {\n    return this.symbol;\n  }\n}\n\n// Creating two players for our game\nconst playerX = new Player('X');\nconst playerO = new Player('O');\n\nconsole.log(`Player 1 is: ${playerX.getSymbol()}`);\nconsole.log(`Player 2 is: ${playerO.getSymbol()}`);\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a `Player` class that can hold a `symbol` (like 'X' or 'O').\n*   When we create a new `Player` object, we give it its unique symbol.\n*   We can then ask the `Player` object what its symbol is using `getSymbol()`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nPlayer 1 is: X\nPlayer 2 is: O\n```\n\nThis simple setup allows the `Game` to keep track of who is who.\n\n## Inside the Player Abstraction\n\nSo, what happens \"under the hood\" when we talk about `Player`s in our game?\n\nWhen the game starts, the `Game` needs to set up the `Player`s. It creates instances of the `Player` class, giving each one its unique identifier (like 'X' or 'O'). Then, as the game progresses, the `Game` will interact with these `Player` objects to manage turns and actions.\n\nHere's a simple sequence of how the `Game` might interact with `Player`s to manage turns:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Game\n    participant PlayerX as Player 'X'\n    participant PlayerO as Player 'O'\n\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n    PlayerX-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerO: It's your turn!\n    PlayerO-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  The `Game` starts and tells `Player 'X'` that it's their turn.\n2.  `Player 'X'` performs an action (like placing their symbol on a [Square](03_square.md)).\n3.  Once `Player 'X'` is done, the `Game` then tells `Player 'O'` that it's their turn.\n4.  This cycle continues, with the `Game` orchestrating whose turn it is by communicating with the `Player` objects.\n\n### Player Code Structure\n\nWhile our `src/main.ts` file is currently very minimal, in a real game, you would likely have a dedicated file for the `Player` class. Let's imagine what that might look like:\n\n```typescript\n// src/player.ts (This is an imagined file for our Player class)\n\nexport class Player {\n  private id: string; // A unique identifier for the player, e.g., 'X', 'O', 'Player 1'\n\n  constructor(id: string) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n\n  // Returns the player's unique identifier\n  getId(): string {\n    return this.id;\n  }\n\n  // In a more complex game, a player might have a score,\n  // or a list of pieces they own. For now, we keep it simple.\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a class `Player` with a `private id` property. This `id` is what makes each player unique.\n*   The `constructor` sets this `id` when a new `Player` is created.\n*   The `getId()` method allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask who this player is.\n\nNow, let's see how the `Game` class might use these `Player` objects:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Simplified example, building on Chapter 4)\nimport { Player } from './player'; // Assuming Player is in its own file\n\nexport class Game {\n  private players: Player[]; // An array to hold all players\n  private currentPlayerIndex: number; // To track whose turn it is\n\n  constructor() {\n    // Initialize our players when the game starts\n    this.players = [new Player('X'), new Player('O')];\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = 0; // Start with the first player (Player 'X')\n    // ... other game setup like creating the Board\n  }\n\n  // Returns the Player object whose turn it currently is\n  getCurrentPlayer(): Player {\n    return this.players[this.currentPlayerIndex];\n  }\n\n  // Advances to the next player's turn\n  nextTurn(): void {\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = (this.currentPlayerIndex + 1) % this.players.length;\n    console.log(`It's now ${this.getCurrentPlayer().getId()}'s turn.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other game logic\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `Game` class now has a `players` array to store all the `Player` objects.\n*   `currentPlayerIndex` keeps track of which player in the array is currently active.\n*   `getCurrentPlayer()` lets any part of the game know who is currently playing.\n*   `nextTurn()` is a simple way to switch to the other player. The `%` (modulo) operator ensures we loop back to the first player after the last player has taken their turn.\n\nThis shows how the `Game` class acts as the manager, using the `Player` objects to keep track of the participants and whose turn it is.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've introduced the `Player` abstraction, which is crucial for any interactive game. We learned that a `Player` represents a participant in the game, providing them with an identity and allowing the game to manage turns and ownership. We saw how the `Game` class uses `Player` objects to keep track of who is playing and whose turn it is.\n\nUnderstanding the `Player` is key to building a dynamic and interactive game. But how does the game *know* what state it's in (e.g., \"X's turn,\" \"Game Over,\" \"X Wins\") and what actions are allowed at any given moment? That's what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into the **Game State Machine**!\n\n[Chapter 6: Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)",
          "# Chapter 6: Game State Machine\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! So far, we've assembled the core pieces of our game. We have the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for player interaction, the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing field, and individual [Square](03_square.md)s making up that board. We also have the overarching [Game](04_game.md) class that brings everything together, and the [Player](05_player.md)s who participate in the game.\n\nBut think about a game you play. It doesn't just *exist*. It goes through different phases, right? First, it might be \"waiting for players,\" then \"player 1's turn,\" then \"player 2's turn,\" and eventually \"game over.\" How do we manage these different phases and ensure the game behaves correctly at each stage?\n\nThat's where the **Game State Machine** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine a simple traffic light. It's not always green, or always red. It cycles through different \"states\": Red, Yellow, Green. And it only changes from Red to Green *after* Yellow, not directly. It follows a specific set of rules for changing states.\n\nOur game is similar! It needs to know what \"state\" it's currently in to decide what actions are allowed and what should happen next. For example:\n*   If it's \"Player 1's Turn,\" only Player 1 should be able to make a move.\n*   If the game is \"Over,\" no more moves should be allowed.\n*   If the game is \"Starting,\" we might need to set up the [Board](02_board.md) and assign [Player](05_player.md)s.\n\nWithout a `Game State Machine`, managing these different phases and rules can become very messy, with lots of `if/else` statements scattered throughout your code. The `Game State Machine` provides a clean, organized way to handle these different stages of your game.\n\n## Understanding Game States and Transitions\n\nThe `Game State Machine` is built on two main ideas:\n\n1.  **States:** These are the distinct phases or conditions your game can be in. Think of them as snapshots of your game's current situation.\n    *   Examples: `WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, `Player2Turn`, `GameOver`, `Paused`.\n2.  **Transitions:** These are the rules that define how your game moves from one state to another. A transition is usually triggered by an \"event.\"\n    *   Examples:\n        *   From `WaitingToStart` to `Player1Turn` (event: \"Game Started\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn` (event: \"Player 1 Made Valid Move\").\n        *   From `Player2Turn` to `GameOver` (event: \"Player 2 Won\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Paused` (event: \"Player Pressed Pause Button\").\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[WaitingToStart] -->|Game Started| B(Player1Turn)\n    B -->|Player 1 Made Move| C(Player2Turn)\n    C -->|Player 2 Made Move| B\n    B -->|Player 1 Won| D{GameOver}\n    C -->|Player 2 Won| D\n    B -->|Player Pressed Pause| E[Paused]\n    E -->|Player Pressed Resume| B\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   The boxes (`WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, etc.) are our **states**.\n*   The arrows are our **transitions**, and the text on the arrows describes the **events** that trigger them.\n\n## How the Game State Machine Works in Our Game\n\nThe `Game` class (from [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) will rely on the `Game State Machine` to know what's currently happening and what actions are allowed.\n\nLet's say a [Player](05_player.md) tries to make a move.\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click.\n2.  It tells the `Game` class about the attempted move.\n3.  The `Game` class then asks the `Game State Machine`: \"Is a move allowed in the current state, and if so, whose turn is it?\"\n4.  The `Game State Machine` checks its current state (e.g., `Player1Turn`). If it's `Player1Turn` and Player 1 made the move, it allows it and then tells the `Game` to update the [Board](02_board.md) and transition to `Player2Turn`.\n\n### Example: Changing Turns\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how the `Game` might interact with a `Game State Machine`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Conceptual)\n\nimport { GameStateMachine, GameState } from './gameStateMachine'; // Imagine this file exists\nimport { Player } from './player'; // From Chapter 5\n\nclass Game {\n  private stateMachine: GameStateMachine;\n  // ... other game properties like board, players\n\n  constructor(player1: Player, player2: Player) {\n    // ... initialize board, players\n    this.stateMachine = new GameStateMachine();\n    this.stateMachine.transition('GAME_STARTED'); // Initial transition\n  }\n\n  handlePlayerMove(player: Player, squareId: string): void {\n    // Check if the move is valid for the current game state\n    if (this.stateMachine.canTransition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE', player)) {\n      // Perform the move on the board (details from Chapter 2 & 3)\n      // ... logic to update the Board ...\n\n      // If move was successful, transition the game state\n      this.stateMachine.transition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE');\n\n      // Update UI to reflect new state (e.g., whose turn it is)\n      // this.uiHandler.updateTurnDisplay(this.stateMachine.getCurrentPlayer());\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Invalid move for current game state or player!\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... other game methods\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The `Game` class creates an instance of `GameStateMachine`.\n*   When the game starts, it tells the `stateMachine` to transition to the initial state (`GAME_STARTED`).\n*   When a player tries to move, the `Game` first asks the `stateMachine` if such a transition (`PLAYER_MADE_MOVE`) is allowed for the current player.\n*   If allowed, the `Game` performs the actual move and then tells the `stateMachine` to update its internal state, which might change whose turn it is.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Game State Machine Manages States\n\nLet's peek inside the `Game State Machine` itself. It needs to keep track of the current state and have rules for how to change it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Flow\n\nWhen an event happens (like a player making a move), here's how the `Game State Machine` helps manage the flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GSM as Game State Machine\n\n    UI->>G: Player clicked Square (e.g., \"A1\")\n    G->>GSM: Request: Can I process 'PLAYER_MOVE' event?\n    GSM-->>G: Response: Yes, current state is 'Player1Turn'.\n    G->>G: Process player move on Board\n    G->>GSM: Notify: 'PLAYER_MOVE' event occurred.\n    GSM->>GSM: Update current state to 'Player2Turn'.\n    GSM-->>G: Response: State updated to 'Player2Turn'.\n    G->>UI: Update UI (e.g., \"Player 2's Turn\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects a player's action and informs the `Game`.\n2.  The `Game` doesn't just blindly execute the action. It first consults the `Game State Machine` to ask, \"Is this action (`PLAYER_MOVE`) valid right now?\"\n3.  The `Game State Machine` checks its `currentState` (e.g., `Player1Turn`) and its internal rules. If the action is valid for that state, it responds \"Yes.\"\n4.  The `Game` then proceeds to perform the actual game logic (like placing a piece on the [Board](02_board.md)).\n5.  After the game logic is done, the `Game` tells the `Game State Machine` that the `PLAYER_MOVE` event has successfully occurred.\n6.  The `Game State Machine` then updates its `currentState` based on its rules (e.g., from `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn`).\n7.  Finally, the `Game` can tell the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to update what the player sees, reflecting the new game state.\n\n### Conceptual Code for Game State Machine\n\nThe `Game State Machine` itself might look something like this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameStateMachine.ts (Conceptual)\n\nexport enum GameState {\n  WaitingToStart = \"WAITING_TO_START\",\n  Player1Turn = \"PLAYER_1_TURN\",\n  Player2Turn = \"PLAYER_2_TURN\",\n  GameOver = \"GAME_OVER\",\n  Paused = \"PAUSED\",\n}\n\nexport class GameStateMachine {\n  private currentState: GameState;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.currentState = GameState.WaitingToStart; // Start here\n  }\n\n  getCurrentState(): GameState {\n    return this.currentState;\n  }\n\n  transition(event: string): void {\n    switch (this.currentState) {\n      case GameState.WaitingToStart:\n        if (event === 'GAME_STARTED') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player1Turn;\n          console.log(\"Game started! It's Player 1's turn.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      case GameState.Player1Turn:\n        if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE') {\n          // Check for win/draw conditions here in a real game\n          // For simplicity, let's just switch turns\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player2Turn;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 moved. It's Player 2's turn.\");\n        } else if (event === 'PLAYER_WON') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.GameOver;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 won! Game Over.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      // ... cases for Player2Turn, GameOver, Paused\n      default:\n        console.log(`Event '${event}' not handled in state ${this.currentState}`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // A method to check if a transition is allowed *before* making it\n  canTransition(event: string, player?: any): boolean {\n    // This would contain more complex logic in a real game\n    // For example, checking if 'player' matches the current turn\n    if (this.currentState === GameState.GameOver) return false;\n    if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE' && \n        (this.currentState === GameState.Player1Turn || this.currentState === GameState.Player2Turn)) {\n        // In a real game, check if 'player' is the current player\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   We define an `enum` called `GameState` to clearly list all possible states.\n*   The `GameStateMachine` class holds the `currentState`.\n*   The `transition` method is the heart of it. When an `event` occurs, it uses a `switch` statement to check the `currentState` and then decides if and how to change to a `nextState`.\n*   The `canTransition` method is a helper that allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask if a certain action is valid *before* trying to perform it. This helps prevent illegal moves.\n\nThis structured approach makes your game logic much easier to understand, maintain, and extend. If you want to add a \"Pause\" state, you just add it to the `GameState` enum and update the `transition` logic in one place.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the **Game State Machine**, a powerful concept for managing the different phases and behaviors of our game. We learned that:\n*   Games go through distinct **states** (like `Player1Turn` or `GameOver`).\n*   **Events** trigger **transitions** between these states according to defined rules.\n*   The `Game State Machine` provides a centralized and organized way for the `Game` class to manage its flow, ensuring that actions are only performed when appropriate for the current game phase.\n\nWith the `Game State Machine`, our game can now intelligently respond to player actions and progress through its lifecycle in a predictable and robust way. We've now covered all the core components of our game's architecture!"

          "# Chapter 1: User Interface Handler\n\nWelcome to the exciting world of game development! In this series, we'll explore the different parts that make up our game, starting with how you, the player, interact with it.\n\nImagine you're playing a game on your computer or phone. How do you tell the game what you want to do? How does the game show you what's happening? That's where the **User Interface Handler** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a simple board game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You need to:\n1.  **See the board**: Where are the X's and O's?\n2.  **Make a move**: Click on an empty square to place your mark.\n3.  **See the result**: Did your move work? Did you win?\n\nWithout a way to do these things, the game would just run by itself, and you couldn't play! The **User Interface Handler** is like the game's eyes and ears, and its mouth. It listens to your actions, translates them for the game's brain, and then shows you what the game's brain decides.\n\n**Our Goal for this Chapter**: Understand how the User Interface Handler acts as the bridge between you and the game, allowing you to click a square and see the game respond.\n\n## The User Interface Handler: Your Game's Best Friend\n\nLet's break down what the User Interface Handler does:\n\n1.  **It Listens to You (Input)**: It constantly watches for your clicks, key presses, or touches. It's like a very attentive waiter waiting for your order.\n2.  **It Shows You Things (Output)**: It's responsible for drawing the game board, showing messages, displaying scores, and generally making sure you can see everything important. This is like the waiter bringing your food and drinks.\n3.  **It Translates Your Actions**: When you click a square, the User Interface Handler doesn't just send \"click!\" to the game. It translates that into something meaningful, like \"Player wants to place a mark on square number 5.\"\n\n## How You \"Use\" the User Interface Handler\n\nAs a player, you don't directly \"call\" the User Interface Handler. Instead, it's always running in the background, ready to react to your actions.\n\nLet's consider our main use case: **Clicking a square on the game board to make a move.**\n\nWhen you click a square on your screen:\n*   The User Interface Handler \"catches\" that click.\n*   It figures out *which* square you clicked.\n*   It then tells the main game logic, \"Hey, the player wants to interact with square (X, Y)!\"\n*   After the game processes your move, the User Interface Handler updates the screen to show the new state of the [Board](02_board.md).\n\nHere's a very simplified idea of what might happen when you click:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of our User Interface Handler\nclass UserInterfaceHandler {\n    // ... other parts of the handler ...\n\n    // This method is called when a player clicks on a visual square\n    handleSquareClick(squareId: string) {\n        console.log(`Player clicked square: ${squareId}`);\n        // In a real game, this would tell the main Game logic\n        // For example: game.makeMove(squareId);\n        // We'll learn more about the Game logic in [Game](04_game.md)!\n    }\n\n    // This method updates what the player sees on the screen\n    updateDisplay(boardData: any) {\n        console.log(\"Updating the game board display...\");\n        // This is where the UI Handler would draw the X's and O's\n        // on the screen based on the latest boardData.\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation**: The `handleSquareClick` method is like the UI Handler noticing you've pointed at something specific. It then logs which `squareId` was clicked. The `updateDisplay` method is how the UI Handler shows you the latest game situation, like drawing an 'X' on the board after a move.\n\n## Under the Hood: How It Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the User Interface Handler connects everything.\n\nThink of the User Interface Handler as a friendly receptionist at a busy hotel.\n\n*   **You (the Player)**: You walk up to the front desk.\n*   **Receptionist (User Interface Handler)**: Greets you and asks what you need.\n*   **Hotel Manager (Game Logic)**: The person who knows all the rules and makes decisions.\n*   **Room Status Board (Game Board)**: Shows which rooms are occupied.\n\nHere's how your request to \"check into a room\" (make a move) might flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UIHandler as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game Logic\n    participant Board as Game Board\n    \n    Player->>UIHandler: Clicks a Square (e.g., \"Square 3\")\n    UIHandler->>Game: Notify: \"Player wants to move on Square 3\"\n    Game->>Game: Process move (e.g., check rules, update Player, Board)\n    Game->>UIHandler: Request: \"Update display with new Board state\"\n    UIHandler->>Board: Get current state of all Squares\n    Board-->>UIHandler: Current Board data (e.g., \"Square 3 now has 'X'\")\n    UIHandler->>Player: Display updated Board on screen\n```\n\n**Step-by-step explanation of the diagram:**\n\n1.  **Player Clicks a Square**: You, the player, click on a visual representation of a [Square](03_square.md) on your screen.\n2.  **UI Handler Notifies Game**: The `User Interface Handler` detects this click. It translates your click into a meaningful message, like \"Player wants to make a move on Square 3,\" and sends it to the main `Game Logic`.\n3.  **Game Processes Move**: The `Game Logic` (which we'll explore in [Game](04_game.md) and [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)) takes this request. It checks if the move is valid, updates the internal game state, and might update the [Player](05_player.md) or the [Board](02_board.md).\n4.  **Game Requests Display Update**: Once the `Game Logic` has finished processing, it tells the `User Interface Handler`, \"Hey, the game state has changed! Please show the player the new situation.\"\n5.  **UI Handler Gets Board State**: The `User Interface Handler` then asks the [Board](02_board.md) for its current data (e.g., which [Square](03_square.md)s have X's, which have O's).\n6.  **Board Provides Data**: The [Board](02_board.md) sends back the information about its current state.\n7.  **UI Handler Displays Updated Board**: Finally, the `User Interface Handler` uses this data to redraw the game board on your screen, showing you the result of your move!\n\nThis entire cycle happens very quickly, making it feel like the game responds instantly to your actions.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we learned that the **User Interface Handler** is the crucial link between you, the player, and the game's internal workings. It's responsible for:\n*   Listening to your input (like clicks).\n*   Translating your input into commands the game understands.\n*   Displaying the game's current state back to you.\n\nIt's like the game's friendly receptionist, ensuring smooth communication!\n\nNow that we understand how you interact with the game, let's dive into what you're actually interacting with: the game board itself.\n\n**Next Chapter**: Let's explore the [Board](02_board.md) and understand how it organizes the game's playing area.",
          "# Chapter 2: Board\n\nWelcome back! In our [previous chapter on the User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), we learned how you, the player, interact with our game. You click buttons, make moves, and the game shows you what's happening. But where do those moves actually *happen*? Where do the game pieces go?\n\nThat's where the **Board** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a physical board game like checkers or chess. You have a physical board with squares, and you place your pieces on those squares. The board is essential because it defines the playing area and holds the current state of the game (where all the pieces are).\n\nIn our digital game, we need a virtual version of that physical board. The `Board` abstraction is like the blueprint and container for our game's playing field. It's responsible for:\n\n1.  **Defining the playing area**: How big is the board? How many squares does it have?\n2.  **Holding the game pieces**: It keeps track of what's on each square.\n3.  **Allowing interaction**: It provides ways to place pieces, remove them, or check what's on a specific spot.\n\nWithout a `Board`, our game pieces would just float in digital space with nowhere to go!\n\n## The Board: A Grid of Possibilities\n\nAt its core, our `Board` is a grid. Think of it like a spreadsheet or a checkerboard. Each cell in that grid is a specific spot where a game piece can be placed. We call these individual spots **Squares**. We'll dive much deeper into [Squares in the next chapter](03_square.md), but for now, just know that the `Board` is made up of many `Square` objects.\n\nLet's look at a simple 3x3 board, like for Tic-Tac-Toe:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Board\n        A1[Square (0,0)] --- A2[Square (0,1)] --- A3[Square (0,2)]\n        B1[Square (1,0)] --- B2[Square (1,1)] --- B3[Square (1,2)]\n        C1[Square (2,0)] --- C2[Square (2,1)] --- C3[Square (2,2)]\n        A1 --- B1 --- C1\n        A2 --- B2 --- C2\n        A3 --- B3 --- C3\n    end\n```\n\nEach `Square` has a unique position (like coordinates `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, etc.) and can hold a game piece or be empty.\n\n## How to Use the Board\n\nLet's imagine we're building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. We'll need to:\n\n1.  **Create a new board**: Set up the playing field.\n2.  **Place a player's mark**: When a player makes a move, we need to update the board.\n3.  **Check a square**: See if a square is empty or occupied.\n\n### 1. Creating a Board\n\nWhen our game starts, one of the first things it does is create a `Board`. This usually involves telling the `Board` how big it should be.\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how you might create a board:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // Imagine this file exists\n\nfunction initializeGame() {\n  const gameBoard = new Board(3, 3); // Create a 3x3 board\n  console.log(\"Board created!\");\n  // ... rest of game setup\n  return gameBoard;\n}\n\nconst myGame = initializeGame();\n// Output: Board created!\n```\n\nIn this example, `new Board(3, 3)` tells the `Board` to set itself up with 3 rows and 3 columns. Internally, it will then create all the individual [Square](03_square.md) objects that make up this grid.\n\n### 2. Placing a Mark on the Board\n\nOnce the board is ready, players will make moves. When a player clicks on a spot (which the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects), the game needs to tell the `Board` to place a piece at that specific location.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists from above\n\nfunction playerMove(row: number, col: number, playerMark: string) {\n  const success = myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(row, col, playerMark);\n  if (success) {\n    console.log(`Placed ${playerMark} at (${row}, ${col})`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Cannot place at (${row}, ${col}). It might be occupied.`);\n  }\n}\n\nplayerMove(0, 0, 'X'); // Player 1 places 'X' at top-left\nplayerMove(1, 1, 'O'); // Player 2 places 'O' in the middle\n// Output:\n// Placed X at (0, 0)\n// Placed O at (1, 1)\n```\n\nThe `placeMark` method is how we update the `Board`'s state. It takes the row, column, and the player's mark (like 'X' or 'O') and tries to put it there.\n\n### 3. Checking a Square\n\nSometimes, the game needs to know what's on a particular square. For example, to check if a square is empty before placing a piece, or to see if a player has won by getting three of their marks in a row.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\n// ... assuming myGame.gameBoard exists and marks have been placed\n\nfunction checkSquareContent(row: number, col: number) {\n  const content = myGame.gameBoard.getMark(row, col);\n  console.log(`Content at (${row}, ${col}): ${content}`);\n}\n\ncheckSquareContent(0, 0); // Check the top-left square\ncheckSquareContent(0, 1); // Check an empty square\n// Output:\n// Content at (0, 0): X\n// Content at (0, 1): Empty\n```\n\nThe `getMark` method allows us to \"look\" at a square and see what's inside without changing anything.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Board Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to understand how the `Board` manages all these [Square](03_square.md) objects and their contents.\n\n### The Board's Internal Structure\n\nWhen you create a `Board`, it doesn't just magically appear. It needs to store all those [Square](03_square.md) objects. A common way to do this is using a 2D array (an array of arrays). Each element in this 2D array would be a reference to a `Square` object.\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\nimport { Square } from './square'; // We'll learn about Square in the next chapter!\n\nexport class Board {\n  private squares: Square[][]; // This will hold our grid of Square objects\n  private rows: number;\n  private cols: number;\n\n  constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n    this.rows = rows;\n    this.cols = cols;\n    this.squares = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n\n    // Loop to create all the individual Square objects\n    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n      this.squares[r] = []; // Create a new row\n      for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n        this.squares[r][c] = new Square(r, c); // Create a new Square for each spot\n      }\n    }\n    console.log(`Board initialized with ${rows * cols} squares.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like placeMark, getMark\n}\n```\n\nWhen `new Board(3, 3)` is called, the `constructor` method runs. It creates a `3x3` grid, and for each spot, it creates a brand new `Square` object, storing it in the `this.squares` array.\n\n### Placing a Mark: A Step-by-Step Process\n\nLet's trace what happens when you call `myGame.gameBoard.placeMark(0, 0, 'X')`:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Game as Game\n    participant Board as Board\n    participant Square as Square\n\n    UI->>Game: Player clicks (0,0)\n    Game->>Board: placeMark(0,0, 'X')\n    Board->>Board: Find Square at (0,0)\n    Board->>Square: setMark('X')\n    Square-->>Board: Mark set successfully\n    Board-->>Game: true (mark placed)\n    Game->>UI: Update display\n```\n\n1.  **User Interaction**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects that the player clicked on the top-left square.\n2.  **Game Logic**: The `Game` object (which we'll cover later) receives this input and decides it's a valid move. It then tells the `Board` to place an 'X' at `(0,0)`.\n3.  **Board Locates Square**: The `Board` uses the `(0,0)` coordinates to find the correct `Square` object within its `squares` grid.\n4.  **Square Updates Itself**: The `Board` then tells *that specific* `Square` object to `setMark('X')`. The `Square` checks if it's empty and, if so, updates its internal state to hold 'X'.\n5.  **Confirmation**: The `Square` confirms back to the `Board` that the mark was placed. The `Board` then confirms back to the `Game`.\n6.  **UI Update**: The `Game` tells the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to visually update the board, showing the 'X' in the top-left corner.\n\nHere's how the `placeMark` method might look inside the `Board` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/board.ts (simplified)\n// ... inside the Board class\n\n  placeMark(row: number, col: number, mark: string): boolean {\n    // Basic validation: check if coordinates are within board limits\n    if (row < 0 || row >= this.rows || col < 0 || col >= this.cols) {\n      console.error(\"Invalid board coordinates!\");\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    const targetSquare = this.squares[row][col]; // Get the specific Square object\n    return targetSquare.setMark(mark); // Ask the Square to set its mark\n  }\n```\n\nNotice how the `Board` doesn't directly store the 'X' or 'O'. Instead, it delegates that responsibility to the individual `Square` objects. This is a powerful concept in programming: breaking down a big problem (managing a whole board) into smaller, manageable pieces (managing individual squares).\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the `Board` abstraction, which is the digital playing field for our game. We learned:\n\n*   The `Board` defines the game's playing area and holds all the game pieces.\n*   It's essentially a grid made up of many individual [Square](03_square.md) objects.\n*   We can create a `Board`, place marks on it, and check the contents of its squares.\n*   Internally, the `Board` manages a 2D array of [Square](03_square.md) objects and delegates the task of holding marks to those individual squares.\n\nThe `Board` provides the structure, but what about the individual spots on the board? How do they know if they're empty or occupied? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we'll dive into the details of the **Square**!\n\n[Next Chapter: Square](03_square.md)",
          "# Chapter 3: Square\n\nWelcome back, aspiring game developers! In our [previous chapter on the Board](02_board.md), we learned that the `Board` is like the playing surface for our game. It's where all the action happens, holding the structure of our game world. But what exactly *makes up* that board?\n\nImagine a chessboard or a checkerboard. It's not just one big flat surface, right? It's divided into many individual spaces. Each of these spaces is distinct, has its own location, and can hold a game piece. In our game, these individual spaces are represented by the **Square** concept!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nThink about playing a game like Tic-Tac-Toe. You have a 3x3 grid. When you make a move, you don't just say \"I'm putting an 'X' on the board.\" You say, \"I'm putting an 'X' in the *top-left square*\" or \"in the *middle-right square*.\"\n\nThe `Square` concept solves the problem of representing these individual, distinct locations on our [Board](02_board.md). Each `Square` knows:\n\n1.  **Where it is**: Its specific position on the board (like a row and column).\n2.  **What's on it**: Whether it's empty, or if a player's piece is currently occupying it.\n\nWithout `Square`s, our `Board` would just be a big, undifferentiated space, and we wouldn't know *where* to place pieces or *which* space a player is interacting with.\n\n## What is a Square?\n\nAt its core, a `Square` is a simple building block. It's like a single tile on a larger mosaic. Each `Square` object in our game holds just enough information to be useful:\n\n*   **Its Coordinates**: Where it lives on the [Board](02_board.md). We often use `row` and `column` numbers for this.\n*   **Its Current State**: What's currently occupying this `Square`? Is it empty, or does it hold a game piece?\n\nLet's look at a simplified idea of what a `Square` might look like in code:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual)\n\nclass Square {\n  row: number;       // Which row is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  column: number;    // Which column is this square in? (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)\n  content: any | null; // What's currently on this square? (e.g., a game piece, or null if empty)\n\n  constructor(row: number, column: number) {\n    this.row = row;\n    this.column = column;\n    this.content = null; // A new square starts empty\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods to check/set content ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when we create a `Square`, we tell it its `row` and `column`. Initially, its `content` is `null`, meaning it's empty.\n\n### How the Board Uses Squares\n\nThe [Board](02_board.md) doesn't just exist; it's made up of many `Square`s! Imagine the `Board` as a grid, and each cell in that grid is an instance of our `Square` class.\n\nWhen the [Board](02_board.md) is created, it creates all the `Square` objects it needs and arranges them. For example, a 3x3 board would create 9 `Square` objects.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Board] --> B[Square (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Square (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Square (0,2)]\n    A --> E[Square (1,0)]\n    A --> F[Square (1,1)]\n    A --> G[Square (1,2)]\n    A --> H[Square (2,0)]\n    A --> I[Square (2,1)]\n    A --> J[Square (2,2)]\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style I fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style J fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nThis diagram shows how a `Board` is composed of many individual `Square` objects, each with its own unique coordinates.\n\n## How to Interact with a Square\n\nAs a player, you don't directly interact with `Square` objects. Instead, you click on a visual representation of a square on your screen. The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) then translates that click into a request to the [Board](02_board.md), which then interacts with the specific `Square` object.\n\nLet's imagine we want to place a piece on a square.\n\n1.  **Check if it's empty**: Before placing a piece, we need to know if the `Square` is already occupied.\n2.  **Place a piece**: If it's empty, we can update the `Square`'s `content`.\n\nHere's how we might add simple methods to our `Square` class to do this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game/square.ts (Conceptual - continued)\n\nclass Square {\n  // ... (row, column, content, constructor as above) ...\n\n  isEmpty(): boolean {\n    return this.content === null; // Is there nothing on this square?\n  }\n\n  placePiece(piece: any): void { // 'any' would be a specific game piece type\n    if (this.isEmpty()) {\n      this.content = piece; // Put the piece on the square\n      console.log(`Piece placed at (${this.row}, ${this.column})`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(`Square at (${this.row}, ${this.column}) is already occupied!`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  getPiece(): any | null {\n    return this.content; // What piece is on this square?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nLet's create a square and try to place a piece on it.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is happening inside the Board or Game logic\nconst mySquare = new Square(1, 1); // Create a square at row 1, column 1\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty? true\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"X\"); // Place an 'X' piece\n// Output: Piece placed at (1, 1)\n\nconsole.log(`Is square empty now? ${mySquare.isEmpty()}`);\n// Output: Is square empty now? false\n\nconsole.log(`What's on the square? ${mySquare.getPiece()}`);\n// Output: What's on the square? X\n\nmySquare.placePiece(\"O\"); // Try to place another piece\n// Output: Square at (1, 1) is already occupied!\n```\n\nThis simple example shows how a `Square` object can manage its own state (what's on it) and provide methods to query or change that state.\n\n## How it Works Internally: A Player's Move\n\nLet's trace a simple interaction: a player clicks on an empty square to place their piece.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant Board\n    participant Square\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on screen at (x,y)\n    UI->>Board: \"Player wants to place piece at (row, col)\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Hey Square (row, col), are you empty?\"\n    Square-->>Board: \"Yes, I am empty!\"\n    Board->>Square: \"Great! Place Player's piece on yourself.\"\n    Square->>Square: Updates its 'content' property\n    Square-->>Board: \"Piece placed!\"\n    Board-->>UI: \"Move successful!\"\n    UI->>Player: Updates screen to show new piece\n```\n\n1.  **Player Clicks**: You, the `Player`, click on a visual square on the screen.\n2.  **UI Notifies Board**: The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click and figures out which `row` and `column` on the game board corresponds to that click. It then tells the `Board` that the player wants to make a move at that specific location.\n3.  **Board Consults Square**: The `Board` then finds the correct `Square` object at the given `row` and `column` from its collection of squares. It asks that `Square`, \"Are you currently empty?\"\n4.  **Square Responds**: The `Square` checks its `content` property. If `content` is `null`, it reports back to the `Board` that it's empty.\n5.  **Board Instructs Square**: Since the `Square` is empty, the `Board` tells the `Square` to `placePiece()` on itself, passing the player's piece.\n6.  **Square Updates**: The `Square` updates its internal `content` property to now hold the player's piece.\n7.  **Success Notification**: The `Square` confirms the piece is placed, the `Board` confirms the move, and the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) updates the visual display for the `Player`.\n\nThis flow shows how the `Square` is a crucial, self-contained unit that manages its own small piece of the game state, allowing the `Board` to coordinate larger game logic.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `Square` concept, understanding it as the fundamental building block of our game [Board](02_board.md). We learned that each `Square` knows its position (row and column) and what content it holds (or if it's empty). We saw how simple methods allow us to check and modify a `Square`'s state, and how the `Board` relies on `Square`s to manage the game's physical layout.\n\nThe `Square` is a small but mighty component, essential for defining the spaces where our game pieces will reside and where players will interact.\n\nNow that we understand the individual `Square`s and how they form the `Board`, it's time to bring everything together and see how the entire **Game** operates!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game](04_game.md)",
          "# Chapter 4: Game\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've explored the foundational elements of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md), which lets you interact with the game. Then, we moved to the [Board](02_board.md), the playing surface, and finally, we zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board.\n\nBut what brings all these pieces together? How do we go from a collection of squares to an actual *game* that you can play? That's where the **Game** abstraction comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're directing a play. You have the stage (`Board`), the individual props (`Square`s), and soon, we'll have the actors (`Player`s). But who tells everyone what to do? Who sets up the stage before the show, tells the actors when to enter, and makes sure the play follows its script?\n\nThat's the role of the `Game`! It's the **main director** or **orchestrator** of our entire game system. Its job is to:\n\n1.  **Set up the stage**: Create the [Board](02_board.md) and prepare it for play.\n2.  **Gather the actors**: Create the [Player](05_player.md)s who will participate.\n3.  **Start the show**: Kick off the game and manage its overall flow from beginning to end.\n4.  **Keep track of the big picture**: Know whose turn it is, if the game is over, and what the current situation is.\n\nWithout `Game`, we'd just have a bunch of disconnected parts. `Game` is what transforms those parts into a playable experience.\n\n## The Director's Role: Key Responsibilities of `Game`\n\nLet's break down the main things our `Game` director is responsible for:\n\n### 1. Initialization: Setting Up the Scene\n\nBefore any action can happen, the `Game` needs to set everything up. This means:\n\n*   Creating a new [Board](02_board.md) instance.\n*   Creating the necessary [Player](05_player.md) instances (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2).\n*   Placing initial game pieces or setting up the board according to the game's rules.\n\n### 2. Orchestration: Guiding the Flow\n\nOnce everything is set up, the `Game` is responsible for guiding the overall flow. While a separate [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) will handle the detailed turn-by-turn logic, the `Game` is the one that *starts* that process and knows when the game has reached its conclusion.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start Game] --> B{Game Initialization};\n    B --> C[Create Board];\n    C --> D[Create Players];\n    D --> E[Place Initial Pieces];\n    E --> F[Begin Game Loop / Turns];\n    F --> G{Game Over?};\n    G -- No --> F;\n    G -- Yes --> H[End Game];\n```\n\nThis diagram shows the high-level flow that the `Game` manages.\n\n## How to Start a New Game\n\nTo get our game running, we simply need to create an instance of our `Game` and tell it to `start()`.\n\nHere's how you might do it in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// src/main.ts (simplified)\nimport { Game } from './game'; // Imagine 'game.ts' exists\n\nexport class App {\n  start() {\n    console.log('Starting the application...');\n\n    // 1. Create a new Game instance\n    const myGame = new Game();\n\n    // 2. Tell the game to start!\n    myGame.start();\n\n    console.log('Game has been initialized and started!');\n  }\n}\n\n// To run this, you'd typically create an App instance and call start()\n// const app = new App();\n// app.start();\n```\n\n**What happens when `myGame.start()` is called?**\n\nWhen you call `start()` on a `Game` object, it kicks off the entire game setup process. You won't see immediate visual output from this tiny snippet, but behind the scenes, the `Game` is busy creating the [Board](02_board.md), setting up [Player](05_player.md)s, and getting ready for the first move. It's like the director shouting \"Action!\"\n\n## Under the Hood: How `Game` Works Internally\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain and see what our `Game` director does when you call `start()`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n\nWhen `game.start()` is called, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n1.  The `App` (our main application entry point) tells the `Game` to `start()`.\n2.  The `Game` first creates a new [Board](02_board.md). This board will be the playing field.\n3.  Next, the `Game` creates the necessary [Player](05_player.md) objects.\n4.  The `Game` then tells the newly created [Board](02_board.md) to set itself up, perhaps by placing initial game pieces on specific [Square](03_square.md)s.\n5.  Finally, the `Game` might inform the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) that the game has started and it's time to display the initial board state to the player. It then hands over control to the [Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md) to manage the actual turns.\n\nHere's a sequence diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as App\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Board\n    participant P as Player\n    participant U as UI Handler\n\n    A->G: start()\n    G->B: new Board()\n    G->P: new Player(1)\n    G->P: new Player(2)\n    G->B: initializeBoard(players)\n    B->>U: updateDisplay(initialState)\n    G->>G: (Hands over to Game State Machine)\n```\n\n### Diving into the Code\n\nLet's look at a simplified version of the `Game` class to see how it performs these steps.\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (simplified)\nimport { Board } from './board'; // We'll learn about Board in Chapter 2\nimport { Player } from './player'; // We'll learn about Player in Chapter 5\nimport { UserInterfaceHandler } from './user_interface_handler'; // Chapter 1\n\nexport class Game {\n  private board: Board;\n  private players: Player[];\n  private uiHandler: UserInterfaceHandler;\n\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('Game: Initializing...');\n    this.uiHandler = new UserInterfaceHandler(); // Create UI handler\n    this.board = new Board(); // Create the Board\n    this.players = [\n      new Player('Player 1'), // Create Player 1\n      new Player('Player 2')  // Create Player 2\n    ];\n    console.log('Game: Board and Players created.');\n  }\n\n  start(): void {\n    console.log('Game: Starting the game!');\n    // Tell the board to set up its initial state\n    this.board.initialize(this.players);\n\n    // Tell the UI to display the initial board\n    this.uiHandler.displayBoard(this.board);\n\n    console.log('Game: Initial setup complete. Ready for turns!');\n    // In a real game, we'd now hand over to a Game State Machine\n    // to manage turns and game logic. (See Chapter 6!)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`constructor()`**: This special method runs automatically when you create a new `Game` object (`new Game()`). Inside, it's busy creating the essential components: a `UserInterfaceHandler`, a `Board`, and two `Player` objects. It's like the director preparing the stage and gathering the actors before the play even begins.\n*   **`start()`**: This method is called when you want the game to actually begin. It tells the `board` to `initialize()` itself (e.g., place pieces), and then tells the `uiHandler` to `displayBoard()` so you can see what's happening. After this, the game is ready for action!\n\nNotice how the `Game` class acts as a central hub, bringing together instances of `Board`, `Player`, and `UserInterfaceHandler`. It doesn't *do* everything itself, but it knows *who* needs to do what and when.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've met the **Game** abstraction, the central director of our entire game system. We learned that `Game` is responsible for:\n\n*   **Orchestrating** the entire game flow.\n*   **Initializing** the [Board](02_board.md) and [Player](05_player.md)s.\n*   **Starting** the game and preparing it for play.\n\nIt's the glue that holds all the other pieces together, transforming individual components into a cohesive, playable experience.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Game` sets up the stage and gets everything ready, it's time to introduce the stars of the show: the players! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the **Player** abstraction and understand their role in the game.\n\n[Next Chapter: Player](05_player.md)",
          "# Chapter 5: Player\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! In our journey so far, we've built up the core physical components of our game. We started with the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for interaction, then moved to the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing surface, and finally zoomed in on the individual [Square](03_square.md)s that make up that board. Most recently, in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md), we saw how the `Game` class brings all these pieces together to form a playable experience.\n\nBut who *plays* the game? Who makes the moves? Who owns the pieces on the [Board](02_board.md)? That's where the **Player** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two participants: one player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. The game needs to keep track of whose turn it is, which symbol belongs to which player, and eventually, who won.\n\nThe `Player` abstraction solves this problem by representing these participants in our game's code. It's like giving each person playing the game a unique identity within the software. Without a `Player` concept, the game wouldn't know who is making a move or whose turn it is, leading to a very confusing and unplayable experience!\n\n## What is a Player?\n\nAt its core, a `Player` is a simple concept: it's an entity that participates in the game. For our purposes, a `Player` needs a few key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Identity**: A way to distinguish one player from another. In Tic-Tac-Toe, this might be their symbol ('X' or 'O').\n2.  **Turn Management**: The game needs to know which `Player` is currently active and allowed to make a move.\n3.  **Ownership**: Players often \"own\" certain elements in the game, like their pieces on the [Board](02_board.md) or the [Square](03_square.md)s they've claimed.\n\nThink of a `Player` as a \"role\" in the game. Just like in a play, each actor has a role, and that role defines what they can do and what they represent. In our game, the `Player` role defines who is 'X' and who is 'O'.\n\n## How the Game Uses Players\n\nThe `Game` class (which we discussed in [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) needs to know about the `Player`s to manage the game flow. For example, when it's time for a move, the `Game` will ask the *current* `Player` to make their move.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how a `Player` might be created and identified:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of setting up our game\nclass Player {\n  private symbol: string; // e.g., 'X' or 'O'\n\n  constructor(symbol: string) {\n    this.symbol = symbol;\n  }\n\n  getSymbol(): string {\n    return this.symbol;\n  }\n}\n\n// Creating two players for our game\nconst playerX = new Player('X');\nconst playerO = new Player('O');\n\nconsole.log(`Player 1 is: ${playerX.getSymbol()}`);\nconsole.log(`Player 2 is: ${playerO.getSymbol()}`);\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a `Player` class that can hold a `symbol` (like 'X' or 'O').\n*   When we create a new `Player` object, we give it its unique symbol.\n*   We can then ask the `Player` object what its symbol is using `getSymbol()`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nPlayer 1 is: X\nPlayer 2 is: O\n```\n\nThis simple setup allows the `Game` to keep track of who is who.\n\n## Inside the Player Abstraction\n\nSo, what happens \"under the hood\" when we talk about `Player`s in our game?\n\nWhen the game starts, the `Game` needs to set up the `Player`s. It creates instances of the `Player` class, giving each one its unique identifier (like 'X' or 'O'). Then, as the game progresses, the `Game` will interact with these `Player` objects to manage turns and actions.\n\nHere's a simple sequence of how the `Game` might interact with `Player`s to manage turns:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Game\n    participant PlayerX as Player 'X'\n    participant PlayerO as Player 'O'\n\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n    PlayerX-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerO: It's your turn!\n    PlayerO-->>Game: (Makes a move)\n    Game->>PlayerX: It's your turn!\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  The `Game` starts and tells `Player 'X'` that it's their turn.\n2.  `Player 'X'` performs an action (like placing their symbol on a [Square](03_square.md)).\n3.  Once `Player 'X'` is done, the `Game` then tells `Player 'O'` that it's their turn.\n4.  This cycle continues, with the `Game` orchestrating whose turn it is by communicating with the `Player` objects.\n\n### Player Code Structure\n\nWhile our `src/main.ts` file is currently very minimal, in a real game, you would likely have a dedicated file for the `Player` class. Let's imagine what that might look like:\n\n```typescript\n// src/player.ts (This is an imagined file for our Player class)\n\nexport class Player {\n  private id: string; // A unique identifier for the player, e.g., 'X', 'O', 'Player 1'\n\n  constructor(id: string) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n\n  // Returns the player's unique identifier\n  getId(): string {\n    return this.id;\n  }\n\n  // In a more complex game, a player might have a score,\n  // or a list of pieces they own. For now, we keep it simple.\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We define a class `Player` with a `private id` property. This `id` is what makes each player unique.\n*   The `constructor` sets this `id` when a new `Player` is created.\n*   The `getId()` method allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask who this player is.\n\nNow, let's see how the `Game` class might use these `Player` objects:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Simplified example, building on Chapter 4)\nimport { Player } from './player'; // Assuming Player is in its own file\n\nexport class Game {\n  private players: Player[]; // An array to hold all players\n  private currentPlayerIndex: number; // To track whose turn it is\n\n  constructor() {\n    // Initialize our players when the game starts\n    this.players = [new Player('X'), new Player('O')];\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = 0; // Start with the first player (Player 'X')\n    // ... other game setup like creating the Board\n  }\n\n  // Returns the Player object whose turn it currently is\n  getCurrentPlayer(): Player {\n    return this.players[this.currentPlayerIndex];\n  }\n\n  // Advances to the next player's turn\n  nextTurn(): void {\n    this.currentPlayerIndex = (this.currentPlayerIndex + 1) % this.players.length;\n    console.log(`It's now ${this.getCurrentPlayer().getId()}'s turn.`);\n  }\n\n  // ... other game logic\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `Game` class now has a `players` array to store all the `Player` objects.\n*   `currentPlayerIndex` keeps track of which player in the array is currently active.\n*   `getCurrentPlayer()` lets any part of the game know who is currently playing.\n*   `nextTurn()` is a simple way to switch to the other player. The `%` (modulo) operator ensures we loop back to the first player after the last player has taken their turn.\n\nThis shows how the `Game` class acts as the manager, using the `Player` objects to keep track of the participants and whose turn it is.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've introduced the `Player` abstraction, which is crucial for any interactive game. We learned that a `Player` represents a participant in the game, providing them with an identity and allowing the game to manage turns and ownership. We saw how the `Game` class uses `Player` objects to keep track of who is playing and whose turn it is.\n\nUnderstanding the `Player` is key to building a dynamic and interactive game. But how does the game *know* what state it's in (e.g., \"X's turn,\" \"Game Over,\" \"X Wins\") and what actions are allowed at any given moment? That's what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into the **Game State Machine**!\n\n[Chapter 6: Game State Machine](06_game_state_machine.md)",
          "# Chapter 6: Game State Machine\n\nWelcome back, future game architects! So far, we've assembled the core pieces of our game. We have the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) for player interaction, the [Board](02_board.md) as our playing field, and individual [Square](03_square.md)s making up that board. We also have the overarching [Game](04_game.md) class that brings everything together, and the [Player](05_player.md)s who participate in the game.\n\nBut think about a game you play. It doesn't just *exist*. It goes through different phases, right? First, it might be \"waiting for players,\" then \"player 1's turn,\" then \"player 2's turn,\" and eventually \"game over.\" How do we manage these different phases and ensure the game behaves correctly at each stage?\n\nThat's where the **Game State Machine** comes in!\n\n## What Problem Does It Solve?\n\nImagine a simple traffic light. It's not always green, or always red. It cycles through different \"states\": Red, Yellow, Green. And it only changes from Red to Green *after* Yellow, not directly. It follows a specific set of rules for changing states.\n\nOur game is similar! It needs to know what \"state\" it's currently in to decide what actions are allowed and what should happen next. For example:\n*   If it's \"Player 1's Turn,\" only Player 1 should be able to make a move.\n*   If the game is \"Over,\" no more moves should be allowed.\n*   If the game is \"Starting,\" we might need to set up the [Board](02_board.md) and assign [Player](05_player.md)s.\n\nWithout a `Game State Machine`, managing these different phases and rules can become very messy, with lots of `if/else` statements scattered throughout your code. The `Game State Machine` provides a clean, organized way to handle these different stages of your game.\n\n## Understanding Game States and Transitions\n\nThe `Game State Machine` is built on two main ideas:\n\n1.  **States:** These are the distinct phases or conditions your game can be in. Think of them as snapshots of your game's current situation.\n    *   Examples: `WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, `Player2Turn`, `GameOver`, `Paused`.\n2.  **Transitions:** These are the rules that define how your game moves from one state to another. A transition is usually triggered by an \"event.\"\n    *   Examples:\n        *   From `WaitingToStart` to `Player1Turn` (event: \"Game Started\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn` (event: \"Player 1 Made Valid Move\").\n        *   From `Player2Turn` to `GameOver` (event: \"Player 2 Won\").\n        *   From `Player1Turn` to `Paused` (event: \"Player Pressed Pause Button\").\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[WaitingToStart] -->|Game Started| B(Player1Turn)\n    B -->|Player 1 Made Move| C(Player2Turn)\n    C -->|Player 2 Made Move| B\n    B -->|Player 1 Won| D{GameOver}\n    C -->|Player 2 Won| D\n    B -->|Player Pressed Pause| E[Paused]\n    E -->|Player Pressed Resume| B\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   The boxes (`WaitingToStart`, `Player1Turn`, etc.) are our **states**.\n*   The arrows are our **transitions**, and the text on the arrows describes the **events** that trigger them.\n\n## How the Game State Machine Works in Our Game\n\nThe `Game` class (from [Chapter 4: Game](04_game.md)) will rely on the `Game State Machine` to know what's currently happening and what actions are allowed.\n\nLet's say a [Player](05_player.md) tries to make a move.\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects the click.\n2.  It tells the `Game` class about the attempted move.\n3.  The `Game` class then asks the `Game State Machine`: \"Is a move allowed in the current state, and if so, whose turn is it?\"\n4.  The `Game State Machine` checks its current state (e.g., `Player1Turn`). If it's `Player1Turn` and Player 1 made the move, it allows it and then tells the `Game` to update the [Board](02_board.md) and transition to `Player2Turn`.\n\n### Example: Changing Turns\n\nHere's a simplified idea of how the `Game` might interact with a `Game State Machine`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/game.ts (Conceptual)\n\nimport { GameStateMachine, GameState } from './gameStateMachine'; // Imagine this file exists\nimport { Player } from './player'; // From Chapter 5\n\nclass Game {\n  private stateMachine: GameStateMachine;\n  // ... other game properties like board, players\n\n  constructor(player1: Player, player2: Player) {\n    // ... initialize board, players\n    this.stateMachine = new GameStateMachine();\n    this.stateMachine.transition('GAME_STARTED'); // Initial transition\n  }\n\n  handlePlayerMove(player: Player, squareId: string): void {\n    // Check if the move is valid for the current game state\n    if (this.stateMachine.canTransition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE', player)) {\n      // Perform the move on the board (details from Chapter 2 & 3)\n      // ... logic to update the Board ...\n\n      // If move was successful, transition the game state\n      this.stateMachine.transition('PLAYER_MADE_MOVE');\n\n      // Update UI to reflect new state (e.g., whose turn it is)\n      // this.uiHandler.updateTurnDisplay(this.stateMachine.getCurrentPlayer());\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Invalid move for current game state or player!\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... other game methods\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The `Game` class creates an instance of `GameStateMachine`.\n*   When the game starts, it tells the `stateMachine` to transition to the initial state (`GAME_STARTED`).\n*   When a player tries to move, the `Game` first asks the `stateMachine` if such a transition (`PLAYER_MADE_MOVE`) is allowed for the current player.\n*   If allowed, the `Game` performs the actual move and then tells the `stateMachine` to update its internal state, which might change whose turn it is.\n\n## Under the Hood: How the Game State Machine Manages States\n\nLet's peek inside the `Game State Machine` itself. It needs to keep track of the current state and have rules for how to change it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Flow\n\nWhen an event happens (like a player making a move), here's how the `Game State Machine` helps manage the flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UI as User Interface Handler\n    participant G as Game\n    participant GSM as Game State Machine\n\n    UI->>G: Player clicked Square (e.g., \"A1\")\n    G->>GSM: Request: Can I process 'PLAYER_MOVE' event?\n    GSM-->>G: Response: Yes, current state is 'Player1Turn'.\n    G->>G: Process player move on Board\n    G->>GSM: Notify: 'PLAYER_MOVE' event occurred.\n    GSM->>GSM: Update current state to 'Player2Turn'.\n    GSM-->>G: Response: State updated to 'Player2Turn'.\n    G->>UI: Update UI (e.g., \"Player 2's Turn\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.  The [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) detects a player's action and informs the `Game`.\n2.  The `Game` doesn't just blindly execute the action. It first consults the `Game State Machine` to ask, \"Is this action (`PLAYER_MOVE`) valid right now?\"\n3.  The `Game State Machine` checks its `currentState` (e.g., `Player1Turn`) and its internal rules. If the action is valid for that state, it responds \"Yes.\"\n4.  The `Game` then proceeds to perform the actual game logic (like placing a piece on the [Board](02_board.md)).\n5.  After the game logic is done, the `Game` tells the `Game State Machine` that the `PLAYER_MOVE` event has successfully occurred.\n6.  The `Game State Machine` then updates its `currentState` based on its rules (e.g., from `Player1Turn` to `Player2Turn`).\n7.  Finally, the `Game` can tell the [User Interface Handler](01_user_interface_handler.md) to update what the player sees, reflecting the new game state.\n\n### Conceptual Code for Game State Machine\n\nThe `Game State Machine` itself might look something like this:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameStateMachine.ts (Conceptual)\n\nexport enum GameState {\n  WaitingToStart = \"WAITING_TO_START\",\n  Player1Turn = \"PLAYER_1_TURN\",\n  Player2Turn = \"PLAYER_2_TURN\",\n  GameOver = \"GAME_OVER\",\n  Paused = \"PAUSED\",\n}\n\nexport class GameStateMachine {\n  private currentState: GameState;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.currentState = GameState.WaitingToStart; // Start here\n  }\n\n  getCurrentState(): GameState {\n    return this.currentState;\n  }\n\n  transition(event: string): void {\n    switch (this.currentState) {\n      case GameState.WaitingToStart:\n        if (event === 'GAME_STARTED') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player1Turn;\n          console.log(\"Game started! It's Player 1's turn.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      case GameState.Player1Turn:\n        if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE') {\n          // Check for win/draw conditions here in a real game\n          // For simplicity, let's just switch turns\n          this.currentState = GameState.Player2Turn;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 moved. It's Player 2's turn.\");\n        } else if (event === 'PLAYER_WON') {\n          this.currentState = GameState.GameOver;\n          console.log(\"Player 1 won! Game Over.\");\n        }\n        break;\n      // ... cases for Player2Turn, GameOver, Paused\n      default:\n        console.log(`Event '${event}' not handled in state ${this.currentState}`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // A method to check if a transition is allowed *before* making it\n  canTransition(event: string, player?: any): boolean {\n    // This would contain more complex logic in a real game\n    // For example, checking if 'player' matches the current turn\n    if (this.currentState === GameState.GameOver) return false;\n    if (event === 'PLAYER_MADE_MOVE' && \n        (this.currentState === GameState.Player1Turn || this.currentState === GameState.Player2Turn)) {\n        // In a real game, check if 'player' is the current player\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   We define an `enum` called `GameState` to clearly list all possible states.\n*   The `GameStateMachine` class holds the `currentState`.\n*   The `transition` method is the heart of it. When an `event` occurs, it uses a `switch` statement to check the `currentState` and then decides if and how to change to a `nextState`.\n*   The `canTransition` method is a helper that allows other parts of the game (like the `Game` class) to ask if a certain action is valid *before* trying to perform it. This helps prevent illegal moves.\n\nThis structured approach makes your game logic much easier to understand, maintain, and extend. If you want to add a \"Pause\" state, you just add it to the `GameState` enum and update the `transition` logic in one place.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we explored the **Game State Machine**, a powerful concept for managing the different phases and behaviors of our game. We learned that:\n*   Games go through distinct **states** (like `Player1Turn` or `GameOver`).\n*   **Events** trigger **transitions** between these states according to defined rules.\n*   The `Game State Machine` provides a centralized and organized way for the `Game` class to manage its flow, ensuring that actions are only performed when appropriate for the current game phase.\n\nWith the `Game State Machine`, our game can now intelligently respond to player actions and progress through its lifecycle in a predictable and robust way. We've now covered all the core components of our game's architecture!"
