      "# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\nWelcome to the first chapter of our journey into understanding how our puzzle game system works! We're going to start with a fundamental building block: the `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n### Project Summary\n\nBefore we dive in, here's a quick overview of the main components we'll be exploring throughout this tutorial:\n\n*   **Puzzle Configuration**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Configuration and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Engine**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Engine and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Slot**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Slot and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Game Grid State**: A comprehensive overview of Game Grid State and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Editor UI**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Editor UI and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **HTML Game Generator**: A comprehensive overview of HTML Game Generator and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Input Controller**: A comprehensive overview of Input Controller and its role in the system architecture.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\n### What Problem Does \"Puzzle Slot\" Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game like Sudoku, a sliding block puzzle, or even a simple tic-tac-toe. All these games happen on a grid, right? Each square on that grid can either be empty, or it can hold a specific piece (like a number in Sudoku, a block in a sliding puzzle, or an 'X'/'O' in tic-tac-toe).\n\nHow do we represent these individual squares in our code? How do we keep track of what's in each one, and where it is on the board? This is exactly the problem the `Puzzle Slot` abstraction solves!\n\nThink of a `Puzzle Slot` as a single, individual square on your game board. It's like one cell in a spreadsheet, but for your game. Each `Puzzle Slot` knows its exact position and what's currently inside it.\n\n#### Use Case: Building a Simple Block Puzzle\n\nLet's say we're building a simple puzzle game where players move colored blocks around a grid. Our game board is a 3x3 grid.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n| R | B |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   | G | R |\n+---+---+---+\n| B |   | G |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nIn this example:\n*   The top-left square contains a Red block.\n*   The top-right square is empty.\n*   The middle-center square contains a Green block.\n\nEach of these nine squares would be represented by a `Puzzle Slot`. A `Puzzle Slot` helps us answer questions like:\n1.  What's at position `(0, 0)` (top-left)? (Answer: A Red block)\n2.  Is position `(0, 2)` (top-right) empty? (Answer: Yes)\n3.  What color block is at position `(1, 1)` (middle-center)? (Answer: Green)\n\n### The Core Idea: What is a Puzzle Slot?\n\nAt its heart, a `Puzzle Slot` is a simple data container. It holds information about a single position on your game grid.\n\nHere are the key pieces of information a `Puzzle Slot` typically stores:\n\n1.  **Location**: Where is this slot on the grid? This is usually represented by `x` and `y` coordinates (or `row` and `column`).\n2.  **Content**: What is currently occupying this slot? Is it empty? Does it hold a specific puzzle piece, a number, a color, or some other game element?\n3.  **Properties (Optional)**: Does this slot have any special rules or characteristics? For example, is it a \"fixed\" slot that the player can't change? Is it a \"goal\" slot that a specific piece needs to reach?\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleSlot {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string content\n        +boolean isFixed\n    }\n```\n*This diagram shows that a `Puzzle Slot` is like a blueprint for an object that has an `x` coordinate, a `y` coordinate, some `content` (like \"Red Block\" or \"empty\"), and a flag `isFixed` to say if it can be changed.*\n\n### How We Use Puzzle Slots\n\nIn our system, `Puzzle Slot` objects are created to represent every single position on the game board. They are then organized and managed by other parts of the system, like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which keeps track of all the slots together to form the complete board.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how you might define a `Puzzle Slot` in code. Remember, we're keeping it super minimal to focus on the core idea!\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleSlot.ts (Conceptual file)\n\ninterface PuzzleSlot {\n  x: number; // The column on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  y: number; // The row on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  content: string | null; // What's in this slot? 'Red Block', 'Blue Block', or null if empty\n  isFixed: boolean; // Can the player change this slot?\n}\n\n// Example of creating a Puzzle Slot\nconst topLeftSlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  content: \"Red Block\",\n  isFixed: false, // Player can move this block\n};\n\nconst emptySlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 2,\n  content: null, // This slot is empty\n  isFixed: false,\n};\n\nconsole.log(topLeftSlot);\n// Output: { x: 0, y: 0, content: 'Red Block', isFixed: false }\n```\n*In this example, we define what a `PuzzleSlot` looks like using an `interface`. Then, we create two example `PuzzleSlot` objects. One holds a \"Red Block\" at `(0,0)`, and another is `empty` at `(0,2)`. Notice how `content` can be `null` to indicate emptiness.*\n\nThis simple structure allows us to describe any square on our puzzle board.\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Slots Work\n\nA `Puzzle Slot` itself doesn't perform complex actions. It's primarily a data structure. Its main job is to *hold* information. Other parts of our system then *read* from and *write* to these `Puzzle Slot` objects.\n\nFor instance, when the game needs to know what's at a specific position, it will ask the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) for the `Puzzle Slot` at those coordinates, and then read its `content`. When a player makes a move, the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) might tell the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to update the `content` of a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\nLet's imagine a very simple flow for how a `Puzzle Slot`'s content might be accessed:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant InputController\n    participant GameGridState\n    participant PuzzleSlot\n\n    Player->>InputController: Tries to move block to (1,1)\n    InputController->>GameGridState: Get slot at (1,1)\n    GameGridState->>PuzzleSlot: What is your content?\n    PuzzleSlot-->>GameGridState: \"Green Block\"\n    GameGridState-->>InputController: Slot (1,1) has \"Green Block\"\n    InputController->>Player: (Decides if move is valid based on content)\n```\n*This sequence diagram shows how a player's action (trying to move a block) eventually leads to the `GameGridState` asking a specific `PuzzleSlot` for its `content`. The `PuzzleSlot` simply provides the data it holds.*\n\nThe `Puzzle Slot` is a foundational piece of data that many other parts of our system rely on. It's like a single brick in a wall – it doesn't build the house, but it's essential for the wall to exist.\n\nWhile the `src/utils.ts` file you saw in the project context contains general utility functions like `formatDate`, it doesn't directly define or manipulate `Puzzle Slot` objects. `Puzzle Slot` definitions would typically reside in a file dedicated to game data structures, like `src/puzzleSlot.ts` (as shown in our conceptual example).\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that a `Puzzle Slot` is a fundamental building block for our puzzle game. It represents a single position on the game board, storing its location, what's inside it, and any special properties it might have. It's a simple data container that helps us describe the state of our game grid.\n\nUnderstanding `Puzzle Slot` is crucial because it's the smallest unit of our game board. In the next chapter, we'll see how these individual `Puzzle Slot`s are brought together to form the complete game board. We'll explore the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which is responsible for managing all the `Puzzle Slot`s and providing a complete picture of the puzzle board at any given moment.\n\nReady to see how all these individual squares form a complete puzzle? Let's move on!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)",
      "# Chapter 2: Game Grid State\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](01_puzzle_slot.md), we explored the `Puzzle Slot`, which is like a single, individual container on our puzzle board. It knows what's inside itself, but it doesn't know anything about its neighbors or the puzzle as a whole.\n\nToday, we're going to zoom out and look at the bigger picture: the `Game Grid State`. If a `Puzzle Slot` is one brick, the `Game Grid State` is the blueprint and current status of the entire wall built from those bricks!\n\n### What Problem Does Game Grid State Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a Sudoku game. You've placed a '5' in one square, a '2' in another, and so on. How does the game know:\n1.  What number is in *every* square?\n2.  If you've made a mistake (e.g., two '5's in the same row)?\n3.  If you've finally completed the puzzle?\n\nThe answer to all these questions lies with the `Game Grid State`. It's the central brain that keeps track of the *entire* puzzle board at any given moment. It holds all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and knows what's inside each one.\n\nOur central use case for this chapter is: **How does the game keep track of all the pieces on the board and update them when a player makes a move?** The `Game Grid State` is designed precisely for this!\n\n### What is Game Grid State?\n\nThink of the `Game Grid State` as a digital map or a spreadsheet of your entire puzzle board. Each cell in this spreadsheet corresponds to a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n\nIt's a single object that contains and manages all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s that make up your puzzle. When you look at the `Game Grid State`, you should be able to tell exactly what's happening on every part of your board.\n\nHere's a simple way to visualize it:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Game Grid State] --> B[Puzzle Slot (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Puzzle Slot (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Puzzle Slot (1,0)]\n    A --> E[Puzzle Slot (1,1)]\n    A --- F[...]\n    F --> G[Puzzle Slot (N,M)]\n\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nIn this diagram, `Game Grid State` is the overarching container, and it holds many individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, each identified by its position (like `(0,0)` for top-left, `(0,1)` for top-middle, etc.).\n\n### How to Use Game Grid State: Updating the Board\n\nLet's go back to our use case: a player makes a move. For example, they place a 'circle' piece into the top-left slot of a 2x2 grid. How does the `Game Grid State` handle this?\n\nThe `Game Grid State` provides methods to interact with the slots it manages. You tell it *which* slot to update (using its row and column) and *what* new content to put there.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might create a `GameGridState` and update one of its slots:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of your game logic\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We're using the PuzzleSlot from Chapter 1!\n\nclass GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // A 2D array to hold all our Puzzle Slots\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = [];\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = [];\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new, empty PuzzleSlot\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us update the content of a specific slot\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        // We'll look at the internal details of this method next!\n        console.log(`Request to update slot at (${row},${col}) with: ${newContent}`);\n        // ... internal logic to find and update the slot ...\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us see what's inside a specific slot\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        // ... internal logic to find and return slot content ...\n        return \"Current Content\"; // Placeholder\n    }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\nconst myGameGrid = new GameGridState(2, 2); // Create a 2x2 puzzle grid\n\nconsole.log(\"Initial content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: Initial content of (0,0): Current Content (or whatever PuzzleSlot defaults to)\n\nmyGameGrid.updateSlotContent(0, 0, \"Circle\"); // Player places a 'Circle' in the top-left slot\n// Output: Request to update slot at (0,0) with: Circle\n\nconsole.log(\"New content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: New content of (0,0): Circle (after the update)\n```\n**Explanation:**\n1.  We create an instance of `GameGridState`, specifying its size (e.g., 2 rows, 2 columns).\n2.  When `updateSlotContent` is called, we tell the `GameGridState` exactly *where* (row 0, column 0) and *what* (\"Circle\") to place.\n3.  The `GameGridState` then takes care of finding the correct [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) and updating its content.\n\n### Internal Implementation: What's Under the Hood?\n\nHow does `GameGridState` actually manage all those [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and update them? Let's peek behind the curtain.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Process\n\nWhen a player makes a move, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PS as Puzzle Slot\n\n    Player->>IC: Clicks on slot (0,0) to place 'X'\n    IC->>GGS: Request: updateSlotContent(0,0, \"X\")\n    GGS->>GGS: Finds the Puzzle Slot at (0,0)\n    GGS->>PS: Calls PS.setContent(\"X\")\n    PS-->>GGS: Slot content updated\n    GGS-->>IC: Update successful\n    IC-->>Player: Shows 'X' on the screen\n```\n\n1.  **Player Interaction**: The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a square on the screen).\n2.  **Input Controller**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (which we'll cover in a later chapter) detects this interaction and translates it into a meaningful action, like \"update slot (0,0) with 'X'\".\n3.  **Game Grid State Request**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) then tells the `Game Grid State` to perform this update.\n4.  **Finding the Slot**: The `Game Grid State` looks through its internal collection of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s to find the one at the specified coordinates (0,0).\n5.  **Updating the Slot**: Once found, the `Game Grid State` doesn't change the content itself. Instead, it asks the specific [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) object to update *its own* content using its `setContent` method (as discussed in [Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)).\n6.  **Confirmation & Display**: The `Game Grid State` confirms the update, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (or another component like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md)) updates the visual display for the player.\n\n#### Code Deep Dive\n\nLet's look at a more complete (but still simplified) version of our `GameGridState` class, imagining it lives in a file like `src/gameGridState.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameGridState.ts\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We import our PuzzleSlot class\n\nexport class GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // This is where we store all our PuzzleSlot objects\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = []; // Create a new row\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new PuzzleSlot instance\n                // and place it in our grid. Each slot starts empty.\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(`Game Grid State initialized with ${rows} rows and ${cols} columns.`);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the PuzzleSlot object at a specific grid position.\n     * This is an internal helper method.\n     */\n    private getSlot(row: number, col: number): PuzzleSlot | undefined {\n        // Check if the requested coordinates are within our grid boundaries\n        if (row >= 0 && row < this.slots.length && col >= 0 && col < this.slots[0].length) {\n            return this.slots[row][col]; // Return the PuzzleSlot object\n        }\n        return undefined; // If out of bounds, return nothing\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Updates the content of a specific PuzzleSlot on the grid.\n     * This is the method external parts of the game would call.\n     */\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col); // Find the correct PuzzleSlot\n        if (targetSlot) {\n            targetSlot.setContent(newContent); // Ask the PuzzleSlot to update itself\n            console.log(`Updated slot at (${row},${col}) with: \"${newContent}\"`);\n        } else {\n            console.warn(`Cannot update: Slot at (${row},${col}) does not exist.`);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Gets the current content of a specific PuzzleSlot.\n     */\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col);\n        return targetSlot ? targetSlot.getContent() : undefined; // Ask the PuzzleSlot for its content\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation:**\n*   **`slots: PuzzleSlot[][]`**: This is the core of `GameGridState`. It's a 2D array (an array of arrays) where each element is an actual `PuzzleSlot` object. This structure perfectly mirrors a grid.\n*   **`constructor(rows, cols)`**: When you create a `GameGridState`, you tell it how big the grid should be. It then loops through each position and creates a new, empty `PuzzleSlot` for it.\n*   **`private getSlot(row, col)`**: This is a helper method (marked `private` because it's mainly for internal use within `GameGridState`). It safely retrieves a `PuzzleSlot` object from the `slots` array based on its coordinates, making sure you don't ask for a slot that doesn't exist.\n*   **`updateSlotContent(row, col, newContent)`**: This is the public method used to change a slot. It first uses `getSlot` to find the right `PuzzleSlot` and then calls that `PuzzleSlot`'s `setContent` method. Notice how `GameGridState` *delegates* the actual content management to the `PuzzleSlot` itself.\n*   **`getSlotContent(row, col)`**: Similarly, this method retrieves the content by asking the specific `PuzzleSlot` for its content using `getContent`.\n\nThis design keeps things organized: `GameGridState` knows *where* all the slots are and how to access them, while each `PuzzleSlot` knows *what* it contains.\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that the `Game Grid State` is the central manager for all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s on our puzzle board. It provides a way to:\n*   Represent the entire puzzle board.\n*   Access and update the content of any specific slot.\n*   Keep track of the current state of the game.\n\nIt's the \"big picture\" that allows our game to understand the overall layout and progress.\n\nNow that we know how to manage the *current* state of our puzzle, a natural question arises: How do we define what the puzzle *should* look like initially? How do we set up the rules or the starting pieces? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)!",
      "# Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](02_game_grid_state.md), we learned about the `Game Grid State`, which is like the current snapshot of our puzzle board – what's in each slot right now. Before that, in [Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md), we met the individual `Puzzle Slot`s, the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to tackle a crucial concept: the `Puzzle Configuration`. If the `Game Grid State` tells us what the puzzle *currently looks like*, the `Puzzle Configuration` tells us *how to build* a specific puzzle from scratch. Think of it as the blueprint or the recipe for a particular puzzle level.\n\n### What Problem Does Puzzle Configuration Solve?\n\nImagine you're designing a new puzzle for our game. You need to decide:\n*   How big should the puzzle board be? (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)\n*   What items should be in each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) when the puzzle starts?\n*   What are the rules for winning this specific puzzle?\n\nWithout a `Puzzle Configuration`, every time you wanted to play a specific puzzle, you'd have to manually set up the board, place all the items, and remember the winning conditions. That's a lot of work and prone to errors!\n\nThe `Puzzle Configuration` solves this by acting as a single, organized place to store *all* the information needed to define a unique puzzle level. It's like a recipe card for a specific cake: it lists all the ingredients, their quantities, and the baking instructions, so anyone can make that exact cake again and again.\n\n### What's Inside a Puzzle Configuration?\n\nA `Puzzle Configuration` holds all the essential details that make one puzzle different from another. Here are the key pieces of information it typically contains:\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions**: The width and height of the puzzle board.\n2.  **Initial Slot Contents**: For each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) on the grid, what item (if any) should it contain when the puzzle begins?\n3.  **Winning Conditions**: What needs to happen for the player to win this puzzle? (e.g., \"all slots must be empty,\" \"specific slots must contain specific items,\" \"a certain pattern must be formed\").\n\nLet's visualize this relationship:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleConfiguration {\n        +int width\n        +int height\n        +List~SlotDefinition~ initialSlots\n        +WinningCondition winningCondition\n    }\n    class SlotDefinition {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string initialItem\n    }\n    class WinningCondition {\n        +string type\n        +object details\n    }\n\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"*\" SlotDefinition : defines initial state for\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"1\" WinningCondition : specifies\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   `PuzzleConfiguration` is our main concept.\n*   It has `width` and `height` to define the grid size.\n*   `initialSlots` is a list of `SlotDefinition`s. Each `SlotDefinition` tells us what should be in a specific `(x, y)` coordinate at the start. This is how we define the initial state of our [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n*   `WinningCondition` describes what makes the puzzle complete.\n\n### How to Define a Puzzle Configuration\n\nLet's say we want to create a very simple 2x2 puzzle. We want it to start with an \"A\" in the top-left corner and an \"B\" in the top-right, with the rest empty. The winning condition is that all slots must be empty.\n\nHere's how we might define this `Puzzle Configuration` in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// Example: Defining a simple 2x2 puzzle configuration\nconst simplePuzzleConfig = {\n  width: 2,\n  height: 2,\n  initialSlots: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, item: \"A\" }, // Top-left slot has 'A'\n    { x: 1, y: 0, item: \"B\" }  // Top-right slot has 'B'\n    // Other slots (0,1) and (1,1) are implicitly empty\n  ],\n  winningCondition: {\n    type: \"all_empty\" // Player wins when all slots are empty\n  }\n};\n\nconsole.log(\"Defined a puzzle configuration:\", simplePuzzleConfig);\n// Output: Defined a puzzle configuration: { width: 2, height: 2, ... }\n```\n\nThis `simplePuzzleConfig` object is now a complete \"recipe\" for our 2x2 puzzle. It's a data structure that can be saved, loaded, and shared. When our game starts, it can read this configuration to set up the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Configuration is Used\n\nSo, we have this `Puzzle Configuration` object. How does the system actually use it to create a playable puzzle?\n\nThink of it as a sequence of events:\n\n1.  **Design**: A puzzle designer (or you, using a tool like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) later) creates a `Puzzle Configuration`.\n2.  **Save/Load**: This configuration is saved (e.g., to a file) and can be loaded by the game.\n3.  **Initialization**: When a player selects a puzzle level, the game loads its corresponding `Puzzle Configuration`.\n4.  **Setup**: The `Puzzle Engine` (which we'll explore in the next chapter!) reads this configuration and uses it to build the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). It creates all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, places the initial items, and stores the winning conditions.\n\nHere's a simplified sequence diagram showing this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant PuzzleEditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant PuzzleEngine as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GameGridState as Game Grid State\n\n    User->>PuzzleEditorUI: Designs a new puzzle\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: Creates/updates configuration data\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEditorUI: Returns configuration\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>User: Saves puzzle level\n\n    User->>PuzzleEngine: Selects a puzzle level\n    PuzzleEngine->>PuzzleConfig: Loads configuration for level\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEngine: Provides configuration data\n    PuzzleEngine->>GameGridState: Initializes grid based on config\n    GameGridState-->>PuzzleEngine: Initial grid ready\n    PuzzleEngine->>User: Presents playable puzzle\n```\n\nIn this flow, the `Puzzle Configuration` acts as the bridge between the puzzle's design and its actual playable state. It's a static description that the dynamic parts of our system (like the `Puzzle Engine` and `Game Grid State`) use to come to life.\n\n### A Glimpse at the Code Structure\n\nWhile the exact implementation can vary, a `Puzzle Configuration` might be represented by a class or an interface that ensures all necessary information is present.\n\nLet's imagine a basic `PuzzleConfiguration` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzle-config.ts (conceptual file)\n\n// Defines what an individual slot should contain initially\ninterface SlotDefinition {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n  item: string | null; // 'null' means empty\n}\n\n// Defines the winning condition for a puzzle\ninterface WinningCondition {\n  type: \"all_empty\" | \"match_pattern\"; // Example types\n  // ... other details based on type\n}\n\nexport class PuzzleConfiguration {\n  readonly width: number;\n  readonly height: number;\n  readonly initialSlots: SlotDefinition[];\n  readonly winningCondition: WinningCondition;\n\n  constructor(width: number, height: number, initialSlots: SlotDefinition[], winningCondition: WinningCondition) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    this.initialSlots = initialSlots;\n    this.winningCondition = winningCondition;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis `PuzzleConfiguration` class provides a structured way to hold all the \"recipe\" information. When the game needs to start a new level, it creates an instance of this class, populating it with the specific details for that level. The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this instance and uses its `width`, `height`, and `initialSlots` to construct the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) with all its [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s correctly set up.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the `Puzzle Configuration`, the essential blueprint for any puzzle level in our game. We learned that it defines the puzzle's dimensions, its starting layout of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, and its winning conditions. It's the static data that brings a specific puzzle to life, acting as a recipe for the dynamic [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\nNow that we know how a puzzle is *defined*, the next logical step is to understand how it actually *runs*! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), which is responsible for taking a `Puzzle Configuration` and making it an interactive, playable experience.",
      "# Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](03_puzzle_configuration.md), we learned about the `Puzzle Configuration`, which is like the rulebook and initial setup instructions for our puzzle game. Before that, we explored the `Game Grid State` ([Chapter 2](02_game_grid_state.md)), which is the current snapshot of our puzzle board, and the individual `Puzzle Slot`s ([Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md)), the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to meet the \"brain\" of our puzzle system: the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### What Problem Does the Puzzle Engine Solve?\n\nImagine you have a board game. You have the board pieces (`Puzzle Slot`s), you know where they are right now (`Game Grid State`), and you have the rulebook (`Puzzle Configuration`). But who actually *plays* the game? Who makes sure moves are valid? Who updates the board when a piece moves? Who tells you when you've won?\n\nThat's exactly what the `Puzzle Engine` does! It's the active component that takes the rules and the current state and *makes the game happen*. It's like the game master or the referee that understands all the rules and manages the flow of play.\n\n**Use Case**: A player clicks on a `Puzzle Slot` to try and make a move. How does the game know if that move is allowed? How does it update the board if it is? The `Puzzle Engine` is responsible for answering these questions and performing the necessary actions.\n\n### The Brain of the Operation\n\nThe `Puzzle Engine` is the central orchestrator for gameplay. Its main jobs include:\n\n1.  **Validating Moves**: When a player tries to do something (like swap two pieces), the `Puzzle Engine` checks the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if that action is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`.\n2.  **Applying Moves**: If a move is valid, the `Puzzle Engine` updates the `Game Grid State` to reflect the change. This might involve changing what's inside one or more `Puzzle Slot`s.\n3.  **Checking Win Conditions**: After each move, or at specific times, the `Puzzle Engine` consults the `Puzzle Configuration` to determine if the player has met the conditions to win the puzzle.\n4.  **Managing Game Flow**: It ensures the game progresses according to its rules.\n\nThink of it this way:\n*   The `Puzzle Configuration` is the *recipe*.\n*   The `Game Grid State` is the *ingredients and what's currently cooking*.\n*   The `Puzzle Engine` is the *chef* who follows the recipe to cook the meal and decides when it's done!\n\n### How the Puzzle Engine Works (High-Level)\n\nLet's trace our use case: a player wants to make a move.\n\n1.  The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a `Puzzle Slot`). This interaction is captured by the `Input Controller` (which we'll cover in [Chapter 5: Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n2.  The `Input Controller` tells the `Puzzle Engine` what the player tried to do.\n3.  The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this player action, looks at the current `Game Grid State`, and consults the `Puzzle Configuration` (the rules).\n4.  Based on the rules, it decides if the move is valid.\n5.  If valid, it updates the `Game Grid State` (changing the contents of `Puzzle Slot`s).\n6.  Finally, it checks if the puzzle is now solved.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n\n    Player->>IC: Tries to make a move (e.g., click)\n    IC->>PE: Request to make move(slotId, action)\n    PE->>GGS: Get current state of slot(s)\n    PE->>PC: Check rules for move validity\n    alt Move is Valid\n        PE->>GGS: Update state (change Puzzle Slot content)\n        PE->>PC: Check for win condition\n        alt Puzzle is Solved\n            PE-->>Player: Puzzle Solved!\n        else\n            PE-->>Player: Move successful!\n        end\n    else Move is Invalid\n        PE-->>Player: Invalid move!\n    end\n```\n\n### Inside the Puzzle Engine\n\nLet's look at a very simplified idea of what the `Puzzle Engine` might look like in code. Remember, we're keeping it super simple to understand the core idea!\n\nImagine a basic `PuzzleEngine` class that needs to know about the `Game Grid State` and the `Puzzle Configuration` to do its job.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified example)\n\nimport { GameGridState } from './game_grid_state'; // From Chapter 2\nimport { PuzzleConfiguration } from './puzzle_configuration'; // From Chapter 3\n\nclass PuzzleEngine {\n  private gridState: GameGridState;\n  private config: PuzzleConfiguration;\n\n  constructor(initialConfig: PuzzleConfiguration) {\n    this.config = initialConfig;\n    // The engine creates the initial game state based on the configuration\n    this.gridState = new GameGridState(initialConfig.initialLayout);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like checkWinCondition, etc.\n}\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n*   The `PuzzleEngine` takes a `PuzzleConfiguration` when it's created. This gives it all the rules and the starting layout.\n*   It then uses this configuration to create an initial `GameGridState`. This means our engine is ready to manage a specific puzzle!\n\nNow, let's see how it might handle a player's move. Let's say our puzzle involves \"flipping\" a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified makeMove method)\n\n// ... (inside the PuzzleEngine class)\n\n  makeMove(slotId: string): boolean {\n    // 1. Check if the move is valid according to the configuration rules\n    if (!this.config.isValidFlip(slotId, this.gridState)) {\n      console.log(`Move on slot ${slotId} is not allowed!`);\n      return false; // Move is invalid\n    }\n\n    // 2. If valid, apply the move to the Game Grid State\n    this.gridState.flipSlot(slotId); // This changes the Puzzle Slot's content\n    console.log(`Slot ${slotId} was flipped.`);\n\n    // 3. After the move, check if the puzzle is now solved\n    if (this.checkWinCondition()) {\n      console.log(\"Congratulations! Puzzle Solved!\");\n    }\n    return true; // Move was successful\n  }\n\n  checkWinCondition(): boolean {\n    // This method would compare the current gridState with the\n    // win condition defined in the PuzzleConfiguration.\n    // For simplicity, let's imagine a simple check:\n    return this.config.isSolved(this.gridState);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this `makeMove` method:\n*   It first asks the `Puzzle Configuration` (`this.config.isValidFlip`) if the proposed move (flipping `slotId`) is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`. This is where the rules come into play!\n*   If the move is valid, it tells the `Game Grid State` (`this.gridState.flipSlot`) to update itself. This means the `Game Grid State` will modify the specific `Puzzle Slot` at `slotId`.\n*   Finally, it calls `checkWinCondition()`, which again uses the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if the current `Game Grid State` matches the winning pattern.\n\nThis shows how the `Puzzle Engine` acts as the central coordinator, using information from the `Puzzle Configuration` and manipulating the `Game Grid State` (which contains our `Puzzle Slot`s) to manage the game.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the role of the `Puzzle Engine`. It's the active \"brain\" of our puzzle system, responsible for interpreting the rules from the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md), managing the current game board through the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), and ensuring the game progresses correctly. It validates player actions, applies changes to the board, and determines when the puzzle is solved.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Puzzle Engine` processes moves, the next logical step is to see how players actually *tell* the engine what they want to do. In our next chapter, we'll explore the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md), which is the bridge between the player and the `Puzzle Engine`.",
      "# Chapter 5: Input Controller\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](04_puzzle_engine.md), we explored the `Puzzle Engine`, which is the \"brain\" of our game, responsible for applying rules and updating the puzzle based on its [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and the current [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). We've learned about the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, the grid, the rules, and the engine that makes it all work.\n\nBut how does a player actually *interact* with this amazing system? How does the game know when you want to move a piece, click a button, or solve a puzzle? That's where the `Input Controller` comes in!\n\n### What Problem Does the Input Controller Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a puzzle game on your computer or phone. You click on a square, or maybe drag a piece from one spot to another. These actions are how you tell the game what you want to do. The game needs a way to \"hear\" these actions, understand them, and then tell the `Puzzle Engine` to react.\n\nThe `Input Controller` is like the game's ears and hands. Its job is to:\n1.  **Listen** for player actions (like mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or touch gestures).\n2.  **Translate** those actions into meaningful game commands (e.g., \"player clicked on slot at row 2, column 3\").\n3.  **Communicate** these commands to the `Puzzle Engine` so the game can respond.\n\nWithout an `Input Controller`, our game would just sit there, beautiful but unresponsive. It's the crucial link that makes the game interactive!\n\n### The Input Controller in Action: A Simple Click\n\nLet's consider a common use case: a player clicks on a specific `Puzzle Slot` on the game board.\n\n**How it works at a high level:**\n\n1.  The player sees the game board on their screen.\n2.  They move their mouse and click on one of the visual representations of a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n3.  The `Input Controller` detects this click.\n4.  It figures out *which* [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked based on where the mouse was.\n5.  It then tells the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), \"Hey, the slot at (this row, this column) was just clicked!\"\n6.  The [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) then decides what to do next (e.g., change the slot's content, check for a match, etc.).\n\n### Analogy: The Game's Receptionist\n\nThink of the `Input Controller` as a very efficient receptionist for our puzzle game.\n\n*   **You (the Player)** walk into the game's \"office\" and say, \"I want to interact with this specific part of the puzzle!\" (This is your mouse click or keyboard press).\n*   **The Receptionist (Input Controller)** hears you, understands *what* you're pointing at, and figures out *which* part of the puzzle you mean.\n*   The receptionist then goes to **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** and says, \"The player wants to do something with the puzzle piece in slot A3.\"\n*   **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** then decides if that action is allowed according to the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and updates the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) accordingly.\n\n### Inside the Input Controller: How it Listens and Commands\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how an `Input Controller` might be set up to listen for clicks.\n\n```typescript\n// src/input_controller.ts (Simplified example)\n\n// We need to tell the Input Controller about our Puzzle Engine\nimport { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md'; \n\nclass InputController {\n    private puzzleEngine: PuzzleEngine; // Our game's brain\n\n    constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine) {\n        this.puzzleEngine = engine;\n        // This line tells the browser to listen for clicks on our 'game-board' element.\n        // When a click happens, it calls our 'handleClick' method.\n        document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));\n        console.log(\"Input Controller is now listening for clicks!\");\n    }\n\n    private handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {\n        // In a real game, we'd calculate which specific Puzzle Slot was clicked\n        // based on 'event.clientX' and 'event.clientY' and the grid layout.\n        // For this example, let's pretend we figured out it was slot (0,0).\n        const clickedRow = 0;\n        const clickedCol = 0;\n\n        console.log(`Player clicked on slot (${clickedRow}, ${clickedCol})`);\n        \n        // Now, we tell the Puzzle Engine what happened!\n        this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example of how you might create and use it in your main application file (src/main.ts)\n// import { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md';\n// import { InputController } from './input_controller.ts'; // Assuming this file exists\n\n// const myPuzzleEngine = new PuzzleEngine(somePuzzleConfiguration); // Imagine this is set up\n// const myInputController = new InputController(myPuzzleEngine);\n// myInputController.startListening(); // A method to start the listeners if not in constructor\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine)`**: When we create an `InputController`, we give it a reference to our `PuzzleEngine`. This is crucial because the `Input Controller` needs to *tell* the engine about player actions.\n2.  **`document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener(...)`**: This is how web applications listen for user interactions. We're saying, \"Hey browser, whenever someone clicks on the HTML element with the ID 'game-board', please run our `handleClick` function.\"\n3.  **`handleClick(event: MouseEvent)`**: This function is called every time a click occurs on the game board.\n    *   `event: MouseEvent` contains details about the click, like where on the screen it happened.\n    *   `const clickedRow = 0; const clickedCol = 0;` (Simplified): In a real game, we'd use the `event` data and knowledge of our [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)'s layout to precisely determine which [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked. For this example, we're just hardcoding it to `(0,0)` to keep it simple.\n    *   **`this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);`**: This is the most important part! The `Input Controller` doesn't *do* the game logic itself. It simply translates the player's action into a command and passes it to the `Puzzle Engine`, which is responsible for processing game rules and updating the game state.\n\n### The Flow of an Input\n\nLet's visualize the journey of a player's click through our system:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as Game UI (HTML)\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on a puzzle slot (e.g., a square on screen)\n    UI->>IC: Notifies of click event (e.g., \"click at x=100, y=50\")\n    IC->>IC: Determines which Puzzle Slot was clicked (e.g., \"slot at row 1, col 2\")\n    IC->>PE: Sends \"SlotClicked\" command (e.g., \"slot(1, 2) clicked\")\n    PE->>GGS: Updates Game Grid State based on game rules\n    GGS-->>PE: State updated (e.g., \"slot(1,2) now contains 'X'\")\n    PE-->>IC: (Optional) Acknowledges or provides feedback\n    IC-->>UI: (Optional) Triggers UI update to show new game state\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `Input Controller` acts as the crucial intermediary. It takes raw user input, makes sense of it in the context of our game, and then hands off a clear instruction to the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Input Controller` is a vital component that bridges the gap between the player and the game's internal logic. It listens for player actions, translates them into game-specific commands, and then passes these commands to the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) for processing. Without it, our beautifully configured puzzles and powerful engine would remain untouched and unplayable. It's what makes our game interactive and fun!\n\nNext, we'll shift gears from playing the game to *creating* the game. We'll explore the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), which is a visual tool designed to help puzzle creators build and configure new puzzles using all the concepts we've learned so far.",
      "# Chapter 6: Puzzle Editor UI\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](05_input_controller.md), we explored the `Input Controller`, which is all about how players interact with an *already existing* puzzle game – clicking, dragging, and making moves. It's the bridge between a player's actions and the game's logic.\n\nBut what if you want to create a *brand new* puzzle? How do you design the starting layout, decide which slots are empty, or place specific items? That's where the `Puzzle Editor UI` comes in!\n\n### The Puzzle Designer's Workbench\n\nImagine you're not just a player, but a puzzle designer. You have an idea for a challenging new puzzle. You need a tool, a \"workbench,\" where you can visually lay out your puzzle, slot by slot, until it looks just right. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is exactly that workbench.\n\nIts main job is to provide a friendly visual interface that allows you to easily create and modify a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md). Remember, the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) is the blueprint for a puzzle – it defines its initial state and rules. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is the tool you use to *draw* that blueprint.\n\n**Use Case**: Let's say you want to design a simple 2x2 puzzle. You want the top-left slot to contain a 'star', the top-right to be 'empty', the bottom-left to contain a 'circle', and the bottom-right to be 'empty'. The `Puzzle Editor UI` lets you click on a visual grid and assign these values, then save your creation.\n\n### What is a UI? (User Interface)\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's quickly clarify \"UI.\" UI stands for **User Interface**. It's simply anything you see and interact with on a screen – buttons, menus, text fields, and in our case, a visual representation of a puzzle grid. It's how a human tells a computer what to do, and how the computer shows information back to the human.\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is the visual part of our system that lets you \"talk\" to the puzzle creation process.\n\n### How the Puzzle Editor UI Works\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` essentially does two main things:\n\n1.  **Visualizes a Puzzle**: It displays a grid, much like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), but for editing purposes. Each square in this grid represents a potential [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n2.  **Allows Interaction**: You can click on these squares (slots) to change what they contain (e.g., from empty to a star, or a circle). It also provides buttons to save your work.\n\nWhen you save your puzzle in the editor, it takes all your visual choices and packages them up into a structured data format – specifically, a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object. This object can then be used by the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to run the game, or by the [HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md) to create a playable version.\n\n#### Step-by-Step: Designing a Puzzle\n\nLet's walk through how you'd use the `Puzzle Editor UI` to create our 2x2 puzzle:\n\n1.  **Open the Editor**: You'd launch the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It might show you an empty grid or load a previously saved puzzle.\n2.  **See the Grid**: The UI displays a grid of editable [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n    *(Imagine this is a visual grid in your browser)*\n3.  **Click to Edit**: You click on the top-left slot. A small menu might pop up, or the slot might cycle through different types (empty, star, circle). You select 'star'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n4.  **Continue Editing**: You click the bottom-left slot and select 'circle'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    | ● |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n5.  **Save Your Work**: Once you're happy with your design, you click a \"Save Puzzle\" button.\n\nWhat happens behind the scenes when you click \"Save\"? The `Puzzle Editor UI` gathers all the information about your visually designed grid and converts it into a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) data structure.\n\nHere's a simplified example of what that saved configuration might look like (as we discussed in [Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)):\n\n```javascript\n// This is the Puzzle Configuration generated by the UI\nconst myNewPuzzleConfig = {\n  id: \"my-first-2x2-puzzle\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  // ... other rules and settings (simplified for example)\n};\n```\n**Output**: The `Puzzle Editor UI` doesn't output a visual, but rather a data structure (like the `myNewPuzzleConfig` above) that describes your puzzle. This data can then be stored and used later.\n\n### Under the Hood: How the Editor Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `Puzzle Editor UI` manages to turn your clicks into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\n#### The Editor's Internal Process\n\nWhen you interact with the `Puzzle Editor UI`, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant EditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant InternalGridData as Editor's Internal Grid Data\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration (File/Object)\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 1. Opens Editor\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 2. Initializes/Loads blank grid\n    EditorUI-->>User: 3. Displays empty grid\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 4. Clicks on a slot (e.g., top-left)\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 5. Updates internal data for that slot (e.g., \"star\")\n    EditorUI-->>User: 6. Updates visual display of the slot\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 7. Clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\n    EditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: 8. Converts InternalGridData to Puzzle Configuration format\n    PuzzleConfig-->>EditorUI: 9. Returns generated config data\n    EditorUI-->>User: 10. Confirms puzzle saved\n```\n\n1.  **Initialization**: When you open the editor, it creates an internal representation of the puzzle grid. This is like a temporary scratchpad where it keeps track of what you're designing.\n2.  **User Interaction**: When you click a slot, the `Puzzle Editor UI` updates this internal scratchpad. It doesn't immediately create a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) file; it just notes down your changes.\n3.  **Saving**: Only when you click \"Save\" does the `Puzzle Editor UI` take everything on its scratchpad and carefully package it into the official [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) format. This format is what the rest of our system understands.\n\n#### Simplified Code Example (Internal Logic)\n\nLet's imagine a very basic way the `Puzzle Editor UI` might manage its internal grid data and then generate a configuration.\n\nFirst, the editor needs a way to store the current state of the puzzle being designed. This could be a simple array of arrays, similar to how `initialState` is represented in a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md):\n\n```javascript\n// Inside the Puzzle Editor UI's logic\nlet currentEditorGrid = [\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"],\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"]\n];\n\n// This represents the 2x2 grid the user sees and interacts with.\n```\nWhen a user clicks on a slot, the editor updates this `currentEditorGrid`. For instance, if the user clicks the top-left slot (row 0, column 0) and sets it to 'star':\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when a user clicks a slot in the UI\nfunction updateSlotInEditor(row, col, value) {\n  currentEditorGrid[row][col] = value;\n  console.log(`Slot (${row}, ${col}) updated to: ${value}`);\n  // The UI would then visually update the displayed slot\n}\n\n// Example: User sets top-left to 'star'\nupdateSlotInEditor(0, 0, \"star\");\n// Example: User sets bottom-left to 'circle'\nupdateSlotInEditor(1, 0, \"circle\");\n\n// currentEditorGrid is now:\n// [\n//   [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n//   [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n// ]\n```\n**Output**: The `console.log` shows the internal update. Visually, the editor would change the appearance of the clicked slot.\n\nFinally, when the user clicks \"Save,\" the `Puzzle Editor UI` takes this `currentEditorGrid` and wraps it into a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object:\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when the user clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\nfunction generatePuzzleConfiguration() {\n  const rows = currentEditorGrid.length;\n  const cols = currentEditorGrid[0].length;\n\n  const newConfig = {\n    id: \"user-designed-puzzle-\" + Date.now(), // Unique ID\n    gridSize: { rows: rows, cols: cols },\n    initialState: currentEditorGrid,\n    // Add other default rules or settings here\n    rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n  };\n\n  console.log(\"Generated Puzzle Configuration:\", newConfig);\n  // This 'newConfig' would then be saved to a file or database.\n  return newConfig;\n}\n\nconst savedConfig = generatePuzzleConfiguration();\n```\n**Output**:\n```\nGenerated Puzzle Configuration: {\n  id: \"user-designed-puzzle-...\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n}\n```\nThis `newConfig` is the valuable output of the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It's a complete blueprint ready for the game!\n\nWhile the `src/config.ts` file (which might contain general settings like `port` or `database`) isn't directly involved in the *logic* of generating a puzzle configuration, a real-world `Puzzle Editor UI` might use such a configuration file to know *where* to save the generated puzzle configurations (e.g., to a specific database or API endpoint).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is your creative hub for designing new puzzles. It provides a visual interface to interact with and modify the layout of a puzzle grid. By clicking and selecting items for individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, you build up your desired puzzle. When you save, the editor translates your visual design into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object, which is the blueprint for any new puzzle. It's the essential tool for anyone who wants to move beyond playing and start creating!\n\nNow that we know how to *create* a puzzle's blueprint using the `Puzzle Editor UI`, the next logical step is to turn that blueprint into a playable game that someone can actually see and interact with in a web browser. In our next chapter, we'll explore the `HTML Game Generator`, which takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and builds the actual web page for the game.\n\n[Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md)",
      "# Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), we explored the `Puzzle Editor UI`. That's where you, the game designer, get to be creative – dragging, dropping, and arranging elements to craft amazing new puzzles. You learned how to define the starting layout and rules, essentially creating a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\nBut once you've designed a masterpiece in the editor, what's next? How do you let someone *play* your game without them needing to open the editor themselves? How do you share your creation with friends, or even upload it to a website?\n\nThis is exactly the problem the `HTML Game Generator` solves! It's like taking your carefully prepared puzzle recipe (the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) and baking it into a delicious, ready-to-eat cake (a standalone HTML game file) that anyone can enjoy with just a web browser.\n\n### What is the HTML Game Generator?\n\nAt its core, the `HTML Game Generator` is a special tool that takes all the information about your puzzle – its size, initial items, and rules (your [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) – and packages it into a single, self-contained `.html` file. This file contains everything needed to play the game:\n\n*   The puzzle's data.\n*   The game's logic (like the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) and [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n*   The visual presentation (HTML and CSS).\n\nThink of it as a \"game exporter.\" You design the puzzle, and the generator creates the playable version.\n\n### Why Do We Need It?\n\nImagine you've spent hours crafting a challenging new puzzle. You want to share it!\n\n*   **For Players**: Players don't need to see the complex editor. They just want to click a file and start playing. The `HTML Game Generator` provides this simple, direct experience.\n*   **For Sharing**: You can send a single `.html` file to a friend, and they can open it in Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser. No installation, no special software needed!\n*   **For Deployment**: If you want to put your game on a website, you can simply upload the generated HTML file.\n\nWithout the `HTML Game Generator`, your amazing puzzles would be stuck inside the editor, unable to be easily shared or played by others.\n\n### How It Works: The Big Picture\n\nThe process is quite straightforward:\n\n1.  You provide the `HTML Game Generator` with a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n2.  It takes a basic HTML template (like a blank canvas for a web page).\n3.  It then \"fills in\" this template by embedding your puzzle's data directly into the HTML.\n4.  It also adds all the necessary JavaScript code for the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) (to run the game logic) and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (to handle player clicks/drags).\n5.  Finally, it gives you back a single string of text, which is the complete HTML content for your game. You can then save this string to a `.html` file.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Puzzle Configuration] --> B{HTML Game Generator};\n    C[HTML Template] --> B;\n    D[Game Logic (JS/CSS)] --> B;\n    B --> E[Generated HTML File];\n```\n\n### Using the HTML Game Generator\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how you might use this generator. Imagine you have a `puzzleConfig` object, which is the result of your work in the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) and contains all the details of your puzzle.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is our Puzzle Configuration data,\n// created by the Puzzle Editor UI (Chapter 6)\nconst myPuzzleConfig = {\n  gridSize: { rows: 3, cols: 3 },\n  initialState: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    { x: 1, y: 0, type: 'block' },\n    { x: 2, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    // ... more puzzle slot data ...\n  ],\n  rules: [\n    { type: 'move', condition: 'adjacent', action: 'swap' }\n    // ... more rules ...\n  ]\n};\n\n// This function would be part of our HTML Game Generator\nfunction generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n  // Internally, this function builds a big HTML string.\n  // For this example, we'll just show a simplified output.\n  return `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n    const initialConfig = ${JSON.stringify(config)};\n    // ... game engine and input controller code would go here ...\n  </script></body></html>`;\n}\n\n// Now, let's generate the HTML for our puzzle!\nconst gameHtmlContent = generateGameHtml(myPuzzleConfig);\n\nconsole.log(\"Generated HTML starts with:\", gameHtmlContent.substring(0, 100));\n// Output: Generated HTML starts with: <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n//         const initialConfig = {\n```\n\nIn this example, `generateGameHtml` takes your `myPuzzleConfig` and returns a long string that represents a complete HTML file. You would then save this string to a file named `my_awesome_puzzle.html`, and anyone could open it in their browser to play!\n\n### Under the Hood: How It Generates the HTML\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `HTML Game Generator` actually constructs that HTML file. It's like a chef assembling a meal: they start with a plate (the HTML template), add the main dish (your puzzle data), and then add the sauces and garnishes (the game logic scripts).\n\nHere's a step-by-step flow of what happens:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Caller as Puzzle Editor UI (or similar)\n    participant HGG as HTML Game Generator\n    participant Template as HTML Template File\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant GameScripts as Game Logic Scripts\n    participant Output as Generated HTML String\n\n    Caller->>HGG: Request game HTML (puzzleConfig)\n    HGG->>Template: Read base HTML structure\n    HGG->>PC: Get serialized puzzle data (JSON)\n    HGG->>GameScripts: Read Puzzle Engine & Input Controller code\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed puzzle data into template\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed game scripts into template\n    HGG->>Output: Return complete HTML string\n    Output-->>Caller: HTML content ready\n```\n\nLet's look at a simplified conceptual code snippet that shows how this might work:\n\n```typescript\n// src/htmlGameGenerator.ts (Conceptual)\n\n// Imagine this is a basic HTML structure with placeholders\n// for where our puzzle data and game scripts will go.\nconst baseHtmlTemplate = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Generated Puzzle Game</title>\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: sans-serif; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; margin: 0; background-color: #f0f0f0; }\n        #game-container { border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; background-color: white; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game-container\">\n        <!-- The game will render here -->\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        // This is where our puzzle configuration will be injected!\n        const initialPuzzleConfig = {{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}};\n    </script>\n    <script>{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n`;\n\n// In a real system, these functions would read actual JavaScript files\n// containing the code for the Puzzle Engine and Input Controller.\nfunction getGameEngineScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n    return `\n        // Simplified Puzzle Engine code\n        class PuzzleEngine {\n            constructor(config) { console.log(\"Engine initialized with config:\", config); }\n            applyMove(state, move) { console.log(\"Applying move:\", move); return state; }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\nfunction getInputControllerScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 5: Input Controller\n    return `\n        // Simplified Input Controller code\n        class InputController {\n            constructor(gameElement, engine) {\n                console.log(\"Input Controller ready for:\", gameElement);\n                gameElement.addEventListener('click', () => engine.applyMove({}, 'click'));\n            }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\n// This is the main function of our HTML Game Generator\nexport function generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n    // 1. Convert the puzzle configuration object into a JSON string.\n    //    This makes it easy to embed directly into JavaScript.\n    const configJson = JSON.stringify(config, null, 2); // 'null, 2' makes it nicely formatted\n\n    // 2. Gather all the necessary game logic scripts.\n    //    This includes the Puzzle Engine, Input Controller, and any\n    //    code to actually start the game.\n    const allGameScripts = `\n        ${getGameEngineScript()}\n        ${getInputControllerScript()}\n\n        // Code to initialize and start the game when the page loads\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n            const gameContainer = document.getElementById('game-container');\n            const engine = new PuzzleEngine(initialPuzzleConfig);\n            new InputController(gameContainer, engine);\n            console.log(\"Game started!\");\n            // In a real game, the engine would render the initial state here\n        });\n    `;\n\n    // 3. Replace the placeholders in our base HTML template\n    //    with the actual puzzle data and game scripts.\n    let finalHtml = baseHtmlTemplate\n        .replace('{{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}}', configJson)\n        .replace('{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}', allGameScripts);\n\n    return finalHtml;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `generateGameHtml` function acts as an assembler. It takes your puzzle's blueprint (`config`), fetches the standard parts (template, engine code, input code), and then carefully puts them all together into a single, functional HTML file.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `HTML Game Generator`, a vital component that bridges the gap between designing a puzzle and playing it. We learned that:\n\n*   It takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) (the rules and initial state of your puzzle).\n*   It combines this data with a basic HTML structure, the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) logic, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) code.\n*   The result is a single, standalone `.html` file that can be opened in any web browser, making your puzzle playable and easily shareable.\n\nThis concludes our journey through the core components of our puzzle game system! We've covered everything from the smallest building block, the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md), to how the entire game is packaged for players. You now have a solid understanding of how these pieces work together to create a complete and interactive puzzle experience."

        "repoAnalysis": "This repository, \"Fifteen_puzzle_maker\" by Kirilllive, is a web-based implementation of the classic Fifteen Sliding Puzzle game. Its primary purpose is to provide a customizable puzzle experience and an editor for users to create their own puzzles using custom images and settings.\n\n### Repository Structure:\n\nThe repository has a straightforward structure, mainly consisting of HTML, CSS (inline in HTML), and JavaScript files, along with image assets.\n\n*   `.github/`: This directory likely contains GitHub-specific configurations, such as workflows for GitHub Pages, given the presence of `_config.yml`.\n*   `README.md`: The main documentation file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and links to the live editor and demo.\n*   `_config.yml`: A Jekyll configuration file, indicating that the repository is set up to be hosted as a GitHub Page.\n*   `art.jpg`: An image file used as a default or example puzzle image.\n*   `example.html`: A basic HTML file demonstrating how to embed and play the puzzle with predefined settings.\n*   `fifteen_puzzle.js`: The core JavaScript logic for the puzzle game.\n*   `icon.jpg`: An icon image for the website.\n*   `index.html`: The main application file, serving as an interactive editor for creating and customizing the puzzle.\n\n### Overall Purpose:\n\nThe project aims to offer a simple, self-contained (no external libraries or Canvas) Fifteen Sliding Puzzle game that can be easily integrated into any web page. A key feature is the interactive editor, which allows users to:\n\n*   Upload their own images.\n*   Adjust puzzle parameters like difficulty, grid size, and animation speed.\n*   Generate a standalone HTML file containing their customized puzzle.\n\n### Main Files and Content:\n\nHere's a detailed look at the content of the key files:\n\n**1. `README.md`**\n```\n![Simple 15 puzzle game javascript HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13263198/211662407-f981cc2c-317b-4c40-a03f-7ba01ff9b8a0.jpg)\n\n# Fifteen Sliding Puzzle maker for HTML \n\nA simple implementation of the classic mini-game Fifteen Sliding Puzzle, using HTML DOM document elements and without using Canvas or third party libraries. \n\nWhen mixing a picture, random replacement of slots is not used, only natural mixing by moving a free slot, thanks to this, an error is excluded, due to which the puzzle may not be assembled.\n\nBy solving the puzzle, you can move several blocks in a column and a row in one move. You can set controls for the GamePad and keyboard.\n\nThe engine code is very flexible for modifications, has many settings and can be integrated into any web page or web app.\n\n\n> Editor: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/\n\n> Demo: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/example.html\n\n\n# Structure\n\nTo use it, you need to create a div element with ID \"fifteen\" and add an array with parameters, the script will do the rest itself. The script is very simple and you can easily add this mini-game to your web page.\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id='fifteen'></div> <!--element \"fifteen\" in which the game will take place-->\n        <script>\n        var setup={\n             puzzle_fifteen:{\n                diff:300,           // Number of movements of the slots for shuffling pictures\n                size:[512,640],     // Clement size \"fifteen\" in pixels only\n                grid:[3,3],         // The number of squares in the height and width of the picture\n                fill:true,          // Stretching the area with the game to fit the element is recommended for fullscreen\n                number:true,        // Slot sequence number\n                art:{\\n                    url:\"art.jpg\",  // Path to the picture (you can use any format of supported browsers, gif-animation and svg)\n                    ratio:false     // Enlarge the picture in height or width\n                },\\n                // optional elements\n                time:\"0.1\",         // block move animation time\n                style:\"border-radius:12px;\", // style for puzzle square\n                emptySlot:[1],      // Empty square number, defaults to the lower right quadrant.\n                keyBoard:true,      // Control using the keys on the keyboard\n                gamePad:true        // Control using the joystick on the Gamepad\n             }\n        }\n        </script>\n        <script src=\"fifteen_puzzle.js\"></script> <!--path to file engine-->\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n# Editor / Demo\n\nYou can upload your image, set parameters and generate an html file with the game and your image. You can use the resulting file on your website or directly on your device, or you can modify it yourself, change the parameters, or write your own script that will run after the game is finished.\n\nPlay online maker: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/\n\nEditor features\n- Automatic style adaptation based on image dimensions\n- Proportional division of an image into blocks\n- Building / exporting HTML file with the game\n- Moving multiple blocks in one move\n- Drag and Drop upload image\n\n[![Simple 15 puzzle game maker for HTML

        "repoContent": "This repository, \"Fifteen_puzzle_maker\" by Kirilllive, is a web-based implementation of the classic Fifteen Sliding Puzzle game. Its primary purpose is to provide a customizable puzzle experience and an editor for users to create their own puzzles using custom images and settings.\n\n### Repository Structure:\n\nThe repository has a straightforward structure, mainly consisting of HTML, CSS (inline in HTML), and JavaScript files, along with image assets.\n\n*   `.github/`: This directory likely contains GitHub-specific configurations, such as workflows for GitHub Pages, given the presence of `_config.yml`.\n*   `README.md`: The main documentation file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and links to the live editor and demo.\n*   `_config.yml`: A Jekyll configuration file, indicating that the repository is set up to be hosted as a GitHub Page.\n*   `art.jpg`: An image file used as a default or example puzzle image.\n*   `example.html`: A basic HTML file demonstrating how to embed and play the puzzle with predefined settings.\n*   `fifteen_puzzle.js`: The core JavaScript logic for the puzzle game.\n*   `icon.jpg`: An icon image for the website.\n*   `index.html`: The main application file, serving as an interactive editor for creating and customizing the puzzle.\n\n### Overall Purpose:\n\nThe project aims to offer a simple, self-contained (no external libraries or Canvas) Fifteen Sliding Puzzle game that can be easily integrated into any web page. A key feature is the interactive editor, which allows users to:\n\n*   Upload their own images.\n*   Adjust puzzle parameters like difficulty, grid size, and animation speed.\n*   Generate a standalone HTML file containing their customized puzzle.\n\n### Main Files and Content:\n\nHere's a detailed look at the content of the key files:\n\n**1. `README.md`**\n```\n![Simple 15 puzzle game javascript HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13263198/211662407-f981cc2c-317b-4c40-a03f-7ba01ff9b8a0.jpg)\n\n# Fifteen Sliding Puzzle maker for HTML \n\nA simple implementation of the classic mini-game Fifteen Sliding Puzzle, using HTML DOM document elements and without using Canvas or third party libraries. \n\nWhen mixing a picture, random replacement of slots is not used, only natural mixing by moving a free slot, thanks to this, an error is excluded, due to which the puzzle may not be assembled.\n\nBy solving the puzzle, you can move several blocks in a column and a row in one move. You can set controls for the GamePad and keyboard.\n\nThe engine code is very flexible for modifications, has many settings and can be integrated into any web page or web app.\n\n\n> Editor: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/\n\n> Demo: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/example.html\n\n\n# Structure\n\nTo use it, you need to create a div element with ID \"fifteen\" and add an array with parameters, the script will do the rest itself. The script is very simple and you can easily add this mini-game to your web page.\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id='fifteen'></div> <!--element \"fifteen\" in which the game will take place-->\n        <script>\n        var setup={\n             puzzle_fifteen:{\n                diff:300,           // Number of movements of the slots for shuffling pictures\n                size:[512,640],     // Clement size \"fifteen\" in pixels only\n                grid:[3,3],         // The number of squares in the height and width of the picture\n                fill:true,          // Stretching the area with the game to fit the element is recommended for fullscreen\n                number:true,        // Slot sequence number\n                art:{\\n                    url:\"art.jpg\",  // Path to the picture (you can use any format of supported browsers, gif-animation and svg)\n                    ratio:false     // Enlarge the picture in height or width\n                },\\n                // optional elements\n                time:\"0.1\",         // block move animation time\n                style:\"border-radius:12px;\", // style for puzzle square\n                emptySlot:[1],      // Empty square number, defaults to the lower right quadrant.\n                keyBoard:true,      // Control using the keys on the keyboard\n                gamePad:true        // Control using the joystick on the Gamepad\n             }\n        }\n        </script>\n        <script src=\"fifteen_puzzle.js\"></script> <!--path to file engine-->\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n# Editor / Demo\n\nYou can upload your image, set parameters and generate an html file with the game and your image. You can use the resulting file on your website or directly on your device, or you can modify it yourself, change the parameters, or write your own script that will run after the game is finished.\n\nPlay online maker: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/\n\nEditor features\n- Automatic style adaptation based on image dimensions\n- Proportional division of an image into blocks\n- Building / exporting HTML file with the game\n- Moving multiple blocks in one move\n- Drag and Drop upload image\n\n[![Simple 15 puzzle game maker for HTML

        "repoAnalysis": "This repository, \"Fifteen_puzzle_maker\" by Kirilllive, is a web-based implementation of the classic Fifteen Sliding Puzzle game. Its primary purpose is to provide a customizable puzzle experience and an editor for users to create their own puzzles using custom images and settings.\n\n### Repository Structure:\n\nThe repository has a straightforward structure, mainly consisting of HTML, CSS (inline in HTML), and JavaScript files, along with image assets.\n\n*   `.github/`: This directory likely contains GitHub-specific configurations, such as workflows for GitHub Pages, given the presence of `_config.yml`.\n*   `README.md`: The main documentation file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and links to the live editor and demo.\n*   `_config.yml`: A Jekyll configuration file, indicating that the repository is set up to be hosted as a GitHub Page.\n*   `art.jpg`: An image file used as a default or example puzzle image.\n*   `example.html`: A basic HTML file demonstrating how to embed and play the puzzle with predefined settings.\n*   `fifteen_puzzle.js`: The core JavaScript logic for the puzzle game.\n*   `icon.jpg`: An icon image for the website.\n*   `index.html`: The main application file, serving as an interactive editor for creating and customizing the puzzle.\n\n### Overall Purpose:\n\nThe project aims to offer a simple, self-contained (no external libraries or Canvas) Fifteen Sliding Puzzle game that can be easily integrated into any web page. A key feature is the interactive editor, which allows users to:\n\n*   Upload their own images.\n*   Adjust puzzle parameters like difficulty, grid size, and animation speed.\n*   Generate a standalone HTML file containing their customized puzzle.\n\n### Main Files and Content:\n\nHere's a detailed look at the content of the key files:\n\n**1. `README.md`**\n```\n![Simple 15 puzzle game javascript HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13263198/211662407-f981cc2c-317b-4c40-a03f-7ba01ff9b8a0.jpg)\n\n# Fifteen Sliding Puzzle maker for HTML \n\nA simple implementation of the classic mini-game Fifteen Sliding Puzzle, using HTML DOM document elements and without using Canvas or third party libraries. \n\nWhen mixing a picture, random replacement of slots is not used, only natural mixing by moving a free slot, thanks to this, an error is excluded, due to which the puzzle may not be assembled.\n\nBy solving the puzzle, you can move several blocks in a column and a row in one move. You can set controls for the GamePad and keyboard.\n\nThe engine code is very flexible for modifications, has many settings and can be integrated into any web page or web app.\n\n\n> Editor: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/\n\n> Demo: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/example.html\n\n\n# Structure\n\nTo use it, you need to create a div element with ID \"fifteen\" and add an array with parameters, the script will do the rest itself. The script is very simple and you can easily add this mini-game to your web page.\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id='fifteen'></div> <!--element \"fifteen\" in which the game will take place-->\n        <script>\n        var setup={\n             puzzle_fifteen:{\n                diff:300,           // Number of movements of the slots for shuffling pictures\n                size:[512,640],     // Clement size \"fifteen\" in pixels only\n                grid:[3,3],         // The number of squares in the height and width of the picture\n                fill:true,          // Stretching the area with the game to fit the element is recommended for fullscreen\n                number:true,        // Slot sequence number\n                art:{\\n                    url:\"art.jpg\",  // Path to the picture (you can use any format of supported browsers, gif-animation and svg)\n                    ratio:false     // Enlarge the picture in height or width\n                },\\n                // optional elements\n                time:\"0.1\",         // block move animation time\n                style:\"border-radius:12px;\", // style for puzzle square\n                emptySlot:[1],      // Empty square number, defaults to the lower right quadrant.\n                keyBoard:true,      // Control using the keys on the keyboard\n                gamePad:true        // Control using the joystick on the Gamepad\n             }\n        }\n        </script>\n        <script src=\"fifteen_puzzle.js\"></script> <!--path to file engine-->\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n# Editor / Demo\n\nYou can upload your image, set parameters and generate an html file with the game and your image. You can use the resulting file on your website or directly on your device, or you can modify it yourself, change the parameters, or write your own script that will run after the game is finished.\n\nPlay online maker: https://kirilllive.github.io/Fifteen_puzzle_maker/\n\nEditor features\n- Automatic style adaptation based on image dimensions\n- Proportional division of an image into

          "# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\nWelcome to the first chapter of our journey into understanding how our puzzle game system works! We're going to start with a fundamental building block: the `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n### Project Summary\n\nBefore we dive in, here's a quick overview of the main components we'll be exploring throughout this tutorial:\n\n*   **Puzzle Configuration**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Configuration and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Engine**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Engine and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Slot**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Slot and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Game Grid State**: A comprehensive overview of Game Grid State and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Editor UI**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Editor UI and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **HTML Game Generator**: A comprehensive overview of HTML Game Generator and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Input Controller**: A comprehensive overview of Input Controller and its role in the system architecture.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\n### What Problem Does \"Puzzle Slot\" Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game like Sudoku, a sliding block puzzle, or even a simple tic-tac-toe. All these games happen on a grid, right? Each square on that grid can either be empty, or it can hold a specific piece (like a number in Sudoku, a block in a sliding puzzle, or an 'X'/'O' in tic-tac-toe).\n\nHow do we represent these individual squares in our code? How do we keep track of what's in each one, and where it is on the board? This is exactly the problem the `Puzzle Slot` abstraction solves!\n\nThink of a `Puzzle Slot` as a single, individual square on your game board. It's like one cell in a spreadsheet, but for your game. Each `Puzzle Slot` knows its exact position and what's currently inside it.\n\n#### Use Case: Building a Simple Block Puzzle\n\nLet's say we're building a simple puzzle game where players move colored blocks around a grid. Our game board is a 3x3 grid.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n| R | B |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   | G | R |\n+---+---+---+\n| B |   | G |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nIn this example:\n*   The top-left square contains a Red block.\n*   The top-right square is empty.\n*   The middle-center square contains a Green block.\n\nEach of these nine squares would be represented by a `Puzzle Slot`. A `Puzzle Slot` helps us answer questions like:\n1.  What's at position `(0, 0)` (top-left)? (Answer: A Red block)\n2.  Is position `(0, 2)` (top-right) empty? (Answer: Yes)\n3.  What color block is at position `(1, 1)` (middle-center)? (Answer: Green)\n\n### The Core Idea: What is a Puzzle Slot?\n\nAt its heart, a `Puzzle Slot` is a simple data container. It holds information about a single position on your game grid.\n\nHere are the key pieces of information a `Puzzle Slot` typically stores:\n\n1.  **Location**: Where is this slot on the grid? This is usually represented by `x` and `y` coordinates (or `row` and `column`).\n2.  **Content**: What is currently occupying this slot? Is it empty? Does it hold a specific puzzle piece, a number, a color, or some other game element?\n3.  **Properties (Optional)**: Does this slot have any special rules or characteristics? For example, is it a \"fixed\" slot that the player can't change? Is it a \"goal\" slot that a specific piece needs to reach?\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleSlot {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string content\n        +boolean isFixed\n    }\n```\n*This diagram shows that a `Puzzle Slot` is like a blueprint for an object that has an `x` coordinate, a `y` coordinate, some `content` (like \"Red Block\" or \"empty\"), and a flag `isFixed` to say if it can be changed.*\n\n### How We Use Puzzle Slots\n\nIn our system, `Puzzle Slot` objects are created to represent every single position on the game board. They are then organized and managed by other parts of the system, like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which keeps track of all the slots together to form the complete board.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how you might define a `Puzzle Slot` in code. Remember, we're keeping it super minimal to focus on the core idea!\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleSlot.ts (Conceptual file)\n\ninterface PuzzleSlot {\n  x: number; // The column on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  y: number; // The row on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  content: string | null; // What's in this slot? 'Red Block', 'Blue Block', or null if empty\n  isFixed: boolean; // Can the player change this slot?\n}\n\n// Example of creating a Puzzle Slot\nconst topLeftSlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  content: \"Red Block\",\n  isFixed: false, // Player can move this block\n};\n\nconst emptySlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 2,\n  content: null, // This slot is empty\n  isFixed: false,\n};\n\nconsole.log(topLeftSlot);\n// Output: { x: 0, y: 0, content: 'Red Block', isFixed: false }\n```\n*In this example, we define what a `PuzzleSlot` looks like using an `interface`. Then, we create two example `PuzzleSlot` objects. One holds a \"Red Block\" at `(0,0)`, and another is `empty` at `(0,2)`. Notice how `content` can be `null` to indicate emptiness.*\n\nThis simple structure allows us to describe any square on our puzzle board.\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Slots Work\n\nA `Puzzle Slot` itself doesn't perform complex actions. It's primarily a data structure. Its main job is to *hold* information. Other parts of our system then *read* from and *write* to these `Puzzle Slot` objects.\n\nFor instance, when the game needs to know what's at a specific position, it will ask the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) for the `Puzzle Slot` at those coordinates, and then read its `content`. When a player makes a move, the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) might tell the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to update the `content` of a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\nLet's imagine a very simple flow for how a `Puzzle Slot`'s content might be accessed:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant InputController\n    participant GameGridState\n    participant PuzzleSlot\n\n    Player->>InputController: Tries to move block to (1,1)\n    InputController->>GameGridState: Get slot at (1,1)\n    GameGridState->>PuzzleSlot: What is your content?\n    PuzzleSlot-->>GameGridState: \"Green Block\"\n    GameGridState-->>InputController: Slot (1,1) has \"Green Block\"\n    InputController->>Player: (Decides if move is valid based on content)\n```\n*This sequence diagram shows how a player's action (trying to move a block) eventually leads to the `GameGridState` asking a specific `PuzzleSlot` for its `content`. The `PuzzleSlot` simply provides the data it holds.*\n\nThe `Puzzle Slot` is a foundational piece of data that many other parts of our system rely on. It's like a single brick in a wall – it doesn't build the house, but it's essential for the wall to exist.\n\nWhile the `src/utils.ts` file you saw in the project context contains general utility functions like `formatDate`, it doesn't directly define or manipulate `Puzzle Slot` objects. `Puzzle Slot` definitions would typically reside in a file dedicated to game data structures, like `src/puzzleSlot.ts` (as shown in our conceptual example).\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that a `Puzzle Slot` is a fundamental building block for our puzzle game. It represents a single position on the game board, storing its location, what's inside it, and any special properties it might have. It's a simple data container that helps us describe the state of our game grid.\n\nUnderstanding `Puzzle Slot` is crucial because it's the smallest unit of our game board. In the next chapter, we'll see how these individual `Puzzle Slot`s are brought together to form the complete game board. We'll explore the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which is responsible for managing all the `Puzzle Slot`s and providing a complete picture of the puzzle board at any given moment.\n\nReady to see how all these individual squares form a complete puzzle? Let's move on!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)",
          "# Chapter 2: Game Grid State\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](01_puzzle_slot.md), we explored the `Puzzle Slot`, which is like a single, individual container on our puzzle board. It knows what's inside itself, but it doesn't know anything about its neighbors or the puzzle as a whole.\n\nToday, we're going to zoom out and look at the bigger picture: the `Game Grid State`. If a `Puzzle Slot` is one brick, the `Game Grid State` is the blueprint and current status of the entire wall built from those bricks!\n\n### What Problem Does Game Grid State Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a Sudoku game. You've placed a '5' in one square, a '2' in another, and so on. How does the game know:\n1.  What number is in *every* square?\n2.  If you've made a mistake (e.g., two '5's in the same row)?\n3.  If you've finally completed the puzzle?\n\nThe answer to all these questions lies with the `Game Grid State`. It's the central brain that keeps track of the *entire* puzzle board at any given moment. It holds all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and knows what's inside each one.\n\nOur central use case for this chapter is: **How does the game keep track of all the pieces on the board and update them when a player makes a move?** The `Game Grid State` is designed precisely for this!\n\n### What is Game Grid State?\n\nThink of the `Game Grid State` as a digital map or a spreadsheet of your entire puzzle board. Each cell in this spreadsheet corresponds to a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n\nIt's a single object that contains and manages all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s that make up your puzzle. When you look at the `Game Grid State`, you should be able to tell exactly what's happening on every part of your board.\n\nHere's a simple way to visualize it:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Game Grid State] --> B[Puzzle Slot (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Puzzle Slot (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Puzzle Slot (1,0)]\n    A --> E[Puzzle Slot (1,1)]\n    A --- F[...]\n    F --> G[Puzzle Slot (N,M)]\n\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nIn this diagram, `Game Grid State` is the overarching container, and it holds many individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, each identified by its position (like `(0,0)` for top-left, `(0,1)` for top-middle, etc.).\n\n### How to Use Game Grid State: Updating the Board\n\nLet's go back to our use case: a player makes a move. For example, they place a 'circle' piece into the top-left slot of a 2x2 grid. How does the `Game Grid State` handle this?\n\nThe `Game Grid State` provides methods to interact with the slots it manages. You tell it *which* slot to update (using its row and column) and *what* new content to put there.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might create a `GameGridState` and update one of its slots:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of your game logic\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We're using the PuzzleSlot from Chapter 1!\n\nclass GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // A 2D array to hold all our Puzzle Slots\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = [];\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = [];\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new, empty PuzzleSlot\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us update the content of a specific slot\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        // We'll look at the internal details of this method next!\n        console.log(`Request to update slot at (${row},${col}) with: ${newContent}`);\n        // ... internal logic to find and update the slot ...\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us see what's inside a specific slot\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        // ... internal logic to find and return slot content ...\n        return \"Current Content\"; // Placeholder\n    }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\nconst myGameGrid = new GameGridState(2, 2); // Create a 2x2 puzzle grid\n\nconsole.log(\"Initial content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: Initial content of (0,0): Current Content (or whatever PuzzleSlot defaults to)\n\nmyGameGrid.updateSlotContent(0, 0, \"Circle\"); // Player places a 'Circle' in the top-left slot\n// Output: Request to update slot at (0,0) with: Circle\n\nconsole.log(\"New content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: New content of (0,0): Circle (after the update)\n```\n**Explanation:**\n1.  We create an instance of `GameGridState`, specifying its size (e.g., 2 rows, 2 columns).\n2.  When `updateSlotContent` is called, we tell the `GameGridState` exactly *where* (row 0, column 0) and *what* (\"Circle\") to place.\n3.  The `GameGridState` then takes care of finding the correct [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) and updating its content.\n\n### Internal Implementation: What's Under the Hood?\n\nHow does `GameGridState` actually manage all those [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and update them? Let's peek behind the curtain.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Process\n\nWhen a player makes a move, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PS as Puzzle Slot\n\n    Player->>IC: Clicks on slot (0,0) to place 'X'\n    IC->>GGS: Request: updateSlotContent(0,0, \"X\")\n    GGS->>GGS: Finds the Puzzle Slot at (0,0)\n    GGS->>PS: Calls PS.setContent(\"X\")\n    PS-->>GGS: Slot content updated\n    GGS-->>IC: Update successful\n    IC-->>Player: Shows 'X' on the screen\n```\n\n1.  **Player Interaction**: The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a square on the screen).\n2.  **Input Controller**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (which we'll cover in a later chapter) detects this interaction and translates it into a meaningful action, like \"update slot (0,0) with 'X'\".\n3.  **Game Grid State Request**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) then tells the `Game Grid State` to perform this update.\n4.  **Finding the Slot**: The `Game Grid State` looks through its internal collection of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s to find the one at the specified coordinates (0,0).\n5.  **Updating the Slot**: Once found, the `Game Grid State` doesn't change the content itself. Instead, it asks the specific [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) object to update *its own* content using its `setContent` method (as discussed in [Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)).\n6.  **Confirmation & Display**: The `Game Grid State` confirms the update, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (or another component like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md)) updates the visual display for the player.\n\n#### Code Deep Dive\n\nLet's look at a more complete (but still simplified) version of our `GameGridState` class, imagining it lives in a file like `src/gameGridState.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameGridState.ts\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We import our PuzzleSlot class\n\nexport class GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // This is where we store all our PuzzleSlot objects\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = []; // Create a new row\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new PuzzleSlot instance\n                // and place it in our grid. Each slot starts empty.\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(`Game Grid State initialized with ${rows} rows and ${cols} columns.`);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the PuzzleSlot object at a specific grid position.\n     * This is an internal helper method.\n     */\n    private getSlot(row: number, col: number): PuzzleSlot | undefined {\n        // Check if the requested coordinates are within our grid boundaries\n        if (row >= 0 && row < this.slots.length && col >= 0 && col < this.slots[0].length) {\n            return this.slots[row][col]; // Return the PuzzleSlot object\n        }\n        return undefined; // If out of bounds, return nothing\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Updates the content of a specific PuzzleSlot on the grid.\n     * This is the method external parts of the game would call.\n     */\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col); // Find the correct PuzzleSlot\n        if (targetSlot) {\n            targetSlot.setContent(newContent); // Ask the PuzzleSlot to update itself\n            console.log(`Updated slot at (${row},${col}) with: \"${newContent}\"`);\n        } else {\n            console.warn(`Cannot update: Slot at (${row},${col}) does not exist.`);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Gets the current content of a specific PuzzleSlot.\n     */\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col);\n        return targetSlot ? targetSlot.getContent() : undefined; // Ask the PuzzleSlot for its content\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation:**\n*   **`slots: PuzzleSlot[][]`**: This is the core of `GameGridState`. It's a 2D array (an array of arrays) where each element is an actual `PuzzleSlot` object. This structure perfectly mirrors a grid.\n*   **`constructor(rows, cols)`**: When you create a `GameGridState`, you tell it how big the grid should be. It then loops through each position and creates a new, empty `PuzzleSlot` for it.\n*   **`private getSlot(row, col)`**: This is a helper method (marked `private` because it's mainly for internal use within `GameGridState`). It safely retrieves a `PuzzleSlot` object from the `slots` array based on its coordinates, making sure you don't ask for a slot that doesn't exist.\n*   **`updateSlotContent(row, col, newContent)`**: This is the public method used to change a slot. It first uses `getSlot` to find the right `PuzzleSlot` and then calls that `PuzzleSlot`'s `setContent` method. Notice how `GameGridState` *delegates* the actual content management to the `PuzzleSlot` itself.\n*   **`getSlotContent(row, col)`**: Similarly, this method retrieves the content by asking the specific `PuzzleSlot` for its content using `getContent`.\n\nThis design keeps things organized: `GameGridState` knows *where* all the slots are and how to access them, while each `PuzzleSlot` knows *what* it contains.\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that the `Game Grid State` is the central manager for all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s on our puzzle board. It provides a way to:\n*   Represent the entire puzzle board.\n*   Access and update the content of any specific slot.\n*   Keep track of the current state of the game.\n\nIt's the \"big picture\" that allows our game to understand the overall layout and progress.\n\nNow that we know how to manage the *current* state of our puzzle, a natural question arises: How do we define what the puzzle *should* look like initially? How do we set up the rules or the starting pieces? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)!",
          "# Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](02_game_grid_state.md), we learned about the `Game Grid State`, which is like the current snapshot of our puzzle board – what's in each slot right now. Before that, in [Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md), we met the individual `Puzzle Slot`s, the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to tackle a crucial concept: the `Puzzle Configuration`. If the `Game Grid State` tells us what the puzzle *currently looks like*, the `Puzzle Configuration` tells us *how to build* a specific puzzle from scratch. Think of it as the blueprint or the recipe for a particular puzzle level.\n\n### What Problem Does Puzzle Configuration Solve?\n\nImagine you're designing a new puzzle for our game. You need to decide:\n*   How big should the puzzle board be? (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)\n*   What items should be in each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) when the puzzle starts?\n*   What are the rules for winning this specific puzzle?\n\nWithout a `Puzzle Configuration`, every time you wanted to play a specific puzzle, you'd have to manually set up the board, place all the items, and remember the winning conditions. That's a lot of work and prone to errors!\n\nThe `Puzzle Configuration` solves this by acting as a single, organized place to store *all* the information needed to define a unique puzzle level. It's like a recipe card for a specific cake: it lists all the ingredients, their quantities, and the baking instructions, so anyone can make that exact cake again and again.\n\n### What's Inside a Puzzle Configuration?\n\nA `Puzzle Configuration` holds all the essential details that make one puzzle different from another. Here are the key pieces of information it typically contains:\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions**: The width and height of the puzzle board.\n2.  **Initial Slot Contents**: For each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) on the grid, what item (if any) should it contain when the puzzle begins?\n3.  **Winning Conditions**: What needs to happen for the player to win this puzzle? (e.g., \"all slots must be empty,\" \"specific slots must contain specific items,\" \"a certain pattern must be formed\").\n\nLet's visualize this relationship:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleConfiguration {\n        +int width\n        +int height\n        +List~SlotDefinition~ initialSlots\n        +WinningCondition winningCondition\n    }\n    class SlotDefinition {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string initialItem\n    }\n    class WinningCondition {\n        +string type\n        +object details\n    }\n\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"*\" SlotDefinition : defines initial state for\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"1\" WinningCondition : specifies\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   `PuzzleConfiguration` is our main concept.\n*   It has `width` and `height` to define the grid size.\n*   `initialSlots` is a list of `SlotDefinition`s. Each `SlotDefinition` tells us what should be in a specific `(x, y)` coordinate at the start. This is how we define the initial state of our [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n*   `WinningCondition` describes what makes the puzzle complete.\n\n### How to Define a Puzzle Configuration\n\nLet's say we want to create a very simple 2x2 puzzle. We want it to start with an \"A\" in the top-left corner and an \"B\" in the top-right, with the rest empty. The winning condition is that all slots must be empty.\n\nHere's how we might define this `Puzzle Configuration` in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// Example: Defining a simple 2x2 puzzle configuration\nconst simplePuzzleConfig = {\n  width: 2,\n  height: 2,\n  initialSlots: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, item: \"A\" }, // Top-left slot has 'A'\n    { x: 1, y: 0, item: \"B\" }  // Top-right slot has 'B'\n    // Other slots (0,1) and (1,1) are implicitly empty\n  ],\n  winningCondition: {\n    type: \"all_empty\" // Player wins when all slots are empty\n  }\n};\n\nconsole.log(\"Defined a puzzle configuration:\", simplePuzzleConfig);\n// Output: Defined a puzzle configuration: { width: 2, height: 2, ... }\n```\n\nThis `simplePuzzleConfig` object is now a complete \"recipe\" for our 2x2 puzzle. It's a data structure that can be saved, loaded, and shared. When our game starts, it can read this configuration to set up the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Configuration is Used\n\nSo, we have this `Puzzle Configuration` object. How does the system actually use it to create a playable puzzle?\n\nThink of it as a sequence of events:\n\n1.  **Design**: A puzzle designer (or you, using a tool like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) later) creates a `Puzzle Configuration`.\n2.  **Save/Load**: This configuration is saved (e.g., to a file) and can be loaded by the game.\n3.  **Initialization**: When a player selects a puzzle level, the game loads its corresponding `Puzzle Configuration`.\n4.  **Setup**: The `Puzzle Engine` (which we'll explore in the next chapter!) reads this configuration and uses it to build the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). It creates all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, places the initial items, and stores the winning conditions.\n\nHere's a simplified sequence diagram showing this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant PuzzleEditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant PuzzleEngine as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GameGridState as Game Grid State\n\n    User->>PuzzleEditorUI: Designs a new puzzle\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: Creates/updates configuration data\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEditorUI: Returns configuration\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>User: Saves puzzle level\n\n    User->>PuzzleEngine: Selects a puzzle level\n    PuzzleEngine->>PuzzleConfig: Loads configuration for level\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEngine: Provides configuration data\n    PuzzleEngine->>GameGridState: Initializes grid based on config\n    GameGridState-->>PuzzleEngine: Initial grid ready\n    PuzzleEngine->>User: Presents playable puzzle\n```\n\nIn this flow, the `Puzzle Configuration` acts as the bridge between the puzzle's design and its actual playable state. It's a static description that the dynamic parts of our system (like the `Puzzle Engine` and `Game Grid State`) use to come to life.\n\n### A Glimpse at the Code Structure\n\nWhile the exact implementation can vary, a `Puzzle Configuration` might be represented by a class or an interface that ensures all necessary information is present.\n\nLet's imagine a basic `PuzzleConfiguration` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzle-config.ts (conceptual file)\n\n// Defines what an individual slot should contain initially\ninterface SlotDefinition {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n  item: string | null; // 'null' means empty\n}\n\n// Defines the winning condition for a puzzle\ninterface WinningCondition {\n  type: \"all_empty\" | \"match_pattern\"; // Example types\n  // ... other details based on type\n}\n\nexport class PuzzleConfiguration {\n  readonly width: number;\n  readonly height: number;\n  readonly initialSlots: SlotDefinition[];\n  readonly winningCondition: WinningCondition;\n\n  constructor(width: number, height: number, initialSlots: SlotDefinition[], winningCondition: WinningCondition) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    this.initialSlots = initialSlots;\n    this.winningCondition = winningCondition;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis `PuzzleConfiguration` class provides a structured way to hold all the \"recipe\" information. When the game needs to start a new level, it creates an instance of this class, populating it with the specific details for that level. The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this instance and uses its `width`, `height`, and `initialSlots` to construct the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) with all its [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s correctly set up.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the `Puzzle Configuration`, the essential blueprint for any puzzle level in our game. We learned that it defines the puzzle's dimensions, its starting layout of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, and its winning conditions. It's the static data that brings a specific puzzle to life, acting as a recipe for the dynamic [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\nNow that we know how a puzzle is *defined*, the next logical step is to understand how it actually *runs*! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), which is responsible for taking a `Puzzle Configuration` and making it an interactive, playable experience.",
          "# Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](03_puzzle_configuration.md), we learned about the `Puzzle Configuration`, which is like the rulebook and initial setup instructions for our puzzle game. Before that, we explored the `Game Grid State` ([Chapter 2](02_game_grid_state.md)), which is the current snapshot of our puzzle board, and the individual `Puzzle Slot`s ([Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md)), the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to meet the \"brain\" of our puzzle system: the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### What Problem Does the Puzzle Engine Solve?\n\nImagine you have a board game. You have the board pieces (`Puzzle Slot`s), you know where they are right now (`Game Grid State`), and you have the rulebook (`Puzzle Configuration`). But who actually *plays* the game? Who makes sure moves are valid? Who updates the board when a piece moves? Who tells you when you've won?\n\nThat's exactly what the `Puzzle Engine` does! It's the active component that takes the rules and the current state and *makes the game happen*. It's like the game master or the referee that understands all the rules and manages the flow of play.\n\n**Use Case**: A player clicks on a `Puzzle Slot` to try and make a move. How does the game know if that move is allowed? How does it update the board if it is? The `Puzzle Engine` is responsible for answering these questions and performing the necessary actions.\n\n### The Brain of the Operation\n\nThe `Puzzle Engine` is the central orchestrator for gameplay. Its main jobs include:\n\n1.  **Validating Moves**: When a player tries to do something (like swap two pieces), the `Puzzle Engine` checks the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if that action is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`.\n2.  **Applying Moves**: If a move is valid, the `Puzzle Engine` updates the `Game Grid State` to reflect the change. This might involve changing what's inside one or more `Puzzle Slot`s.\n3.  **Checking Win Conditions**: After each move, or at specific times, the `Puzzle Engine` consults the `Puzzle Configuration` to determine if the player has met the conditions to win the puzzle.\n4.  **Managing Game Flow**: It ensures the game progresses according to its rules.\n\nThink of it this way:\n*   The `Puzzle Configuration` is the *recipe*.\n*   The `Game Grid State` is the *ingredients and what's currently cooking*.\n*   The `Puzzle Engine` is the *chef* who follows the recipe to cook the meal and decides when it's done!\n\n### How the Puzzle Engine Works (High-Level)\n\nLet's trace our use case: a player wants to make a move.\n\n1.  The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a `Puzzle Slot`). This interaction is captured by the `Input Controller` (which we'll cover in [Chapter 5: Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n2.  The `Input Controller` tells the `Puzzle Engine` what the player tried to do.\n3.  The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this player action, looks at the current `Game Grid State`, and consults the `Puzzle Configuration` (the rules).\n4.  Based on the rules, it decides if the move is valid.\n5.  If valid, it updates the `Game Grid State` (changing the contents of `Puzzle Slot`s).\n6.  Finally, it checks if the puzzle is now solved.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n\n    Player->>IC: Tries to make a move (e.g., click)\n    IC->>PE: Request to make move(slotId, action)\n    PE->>GGS: Get current state of slot(s)\n    PE->>PC: Check rules for move validity\n    alt Move is Valid\n        PE->>GGS: Update state (change Puzzle Slot content)\n        PE->>PC: Check for win condition\n        alt Puzzle is Solved\n            PE-->>Player: Puzzle Solved!\n        else\n            PE-->>Player: Move successful!\n        end\n    else Move is Invalid\n        PE-->>Player: Invalid move!\n    end\n```\n\n### Inside the Puzzle Engine\n\nLet's look at a very simplified idea of what the `Puzzle Engine` might look like in code. Remember, we're keeping it super simple to understand the core idea!\n\nImagine a basic `PuzzleEngine` class that needs to know about the `Game Grid State` and the `Puzzle Configuration` to do its job.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified example)\n\nimport { GameGridState } from './game_grid_state'; // From Chapter 2\nimport { PuzzleConfiguration } from './puzzle_configuration'; // From Chapter 3\n\nclass PuzzleEngine {\n  private gridState: GameGridState;\n  private config: PuzzleConfiguration;\n\n  constructor(initialConfig: PuzzleConfiguration) {\n    this.config = initialConfig;\n    // The engine creates the initial game state based on the configuration\n    this.gridState = new GameGridState(initialConfig.initialLayout);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like checkWinCondition, etc.\n}\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n*   The `PuzzleEngine` takes a `PuzzleConfiguration` when it's created. This gives it all the rules and the starting layout.\n*   It then uses this configuration to create an initial `GameGridState`. This means our engine is ready to manage a specific puzzle!\n\nNow, let's see how it might handle a player's move. Let's say our puzzle involves \"flipping\" a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified makeMove method)\n\n// ... (inside the PuzzleEngine class)\n\n  makeMove(slotId: string): boolean {\n    // 1. Check if the move is valid according to the configuration rules\n    if (!this.config.isValidFlip(slotId, this.gridState)) {\n      console.log(`Move on slot ${slotId} is not allowed!`);\n      return false; // Move is invalid\n    }\n\n    // 2. If valid, apply the move to the Game Grid State\n    this.gridState.flipSlot(slotId); // This changes the Puzzle Slot's content\n    console.log(`Slot ${slotId} was flipped.`);\n\n    // 3. After the move, check if the puzzle is now solved\n    if (this.checkWinCondition()) {\n      console.log(\"Congratulations! Puzzle Solved!\");\n    }\n    return true; // Move was successful\n  }\n\n  checkWinCondition(): boolean {\n    // This method would compare the current gridState with the\n    // win condition defined in the PuzzleConfiguration.\n    // For simplicity, let's imagine a simple check:\n    return this.config.isSolved(this.gridState);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this `makeMove` method:\n*   It first asks the `Puzzle Configuration` (`this.config.isValidFlip`) if the proposed move (flipping `slotId`) is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`. This is where the rules come into play!\n*   If the move is valid, it tells the `Game Grid State` (`this.gridState.flipSlot`) to update itself. This means the `Game Grid State` will modify the specific `Puzzle Slot` at `slotId`.\n*   Finally, it calls `checkWinCondition()`, which again uses the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if the current `Game Grid State` matches the winning pattern.\n\nThis shows how the `Puzzle Engine` acts as the central coordinator, using information from the `Puzzle Configuration` and manipulating the `Game Grid State` (which contains our `Puzzle Slot`s) to manage the game.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the role of the `Puzzle Engine`. It's the active \"brain\" of our puzzle system, responsible for interpreting the rules from the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md), managing the current game board through the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), and ensuring the game progresses correctly. It validates player actions, applies changes to the board, and determines when the puzzle is solved.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Puzzle Engine` processes moves, the next logical step is to see how players actually *tell* the engine what they want to do. In our next chapter, we'll explore the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md), which is the bridge between the player and the `Puzzle Engine`.",
          "# Chapter 5: Input Controller\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](04_puzzle_engine.md), we explored the `Puzzle Engine`, which is the \"brain\" of our game, responsible for applying rules and updating the puzzle based on its [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and the current [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). We've learned about the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, the grid, the rules, and the engine that makes it all work.\n\nBut how does a player actually *interact* with this amazing system? How does the game know when you want to move a piece, click a button, or solve a puzzle? That's where the `Input Controller` comes in!\n\n### What Problem Does the Input Controller Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a puzzle game on your computer or phone. You click on a square, or maybe drag a piece from one spot to another. These actions are how you tell the game what you want to do. The game needs a way to \"hear\" these actions, understand them, and then tell the `Puzzle Engine` to react.\n\nThe `Input Controller` is like the game's ears and hands. Its job is to:\n1.  **Listen** for player actions (like mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or touch gestures).\n2.  **Translate** those actions into meaningful game commands (e.g., \"player clicked on slot at row 2, column 3\").\n3.  **Communicate** these commands to the `Puzzle Engine` so the game can respond.\n\nWithout an `Input Controller`, our game would just sit there, beautiful but unresponsive. It's the crucial link that makes the game interactive!\n\n### The Input Controller in Action: A Simple Click\n\nLet's consider a common use case: a player clicks on a specific `Puzzle Slot` on the game board.\n\n**How it works at a high level:**\n\n1.  The player sees the game board on their screen.\n2.  They move their mouse and click on one of the visual representations of a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n3.  The `Input Controller` detects this click.\n4.  It figures out *which* [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked based on where the mouse was.\n5.  It then tells the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), \"Hey, the slot at (this row, this column) was just clicked!\"\n6.  The [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) then decides what to do next (e.g., change the slot's content, check for a match, etc.).\n\n### Analogy: The Game's Receptionist\n\nThink of the `Input Controller` as a very efficient receptionist for our puzzle game.\n\n*   **You (the Player)** walk into the game's \"office\" and say, \"I want to interact with this specific part of the puzzle!\" (This is your mouse click or keyboard press).\n*   **The Receptionist (Input Controller)** hears you, understands *what* you're pointing at, and figures out *which* part of the puzzle you mean.\n*   The receptionist then goes to **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** and says, \"The player wants to do something with the puzzle piece in slot A3.\"\n*   **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** then decides if that action is allowed according to the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and updates the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) accordingly.\n\n### Inside the Input Controller: How it Listens and Commands\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how an `Input Controller` might be set up to listen for clicks.\n\n```typescript\n// src/input_controller.ts (Simplified example)\n\n// We need to tell the Input Controller about our Puzzle Engine\nimport { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md'; \n\nclass InputController {\n    private puzzleEngine: PuzzleEngine; // Our game's brain\n\n    constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine) {\n        this.puzzleEngine = engine;\n        // This line tells the browser to listen for clicks on our 'game-board' element.\n        // When a click happens, it calls our 'handleClick' method.\n        document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));\n        console.log(\"Input Controller is now listening for clicks!\");\n    }\n\n    private handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {\n        // In a real game, we'd calculate which specific Puzzle Slot was clicked\n        // based on 'event.clientX' and 'event.clientY' and the grid layout.\n        // For this example, let's pretend we figured out it was slot (0,0).\n        const clickedRow = 0;\n        const clickedCol = 0;\n\n        console.log(`Player clicked on slot (${clickedRow}, ${clickedCol})`);\n        \n        // Now, we tell the Puzzle Engine what happened!\n        this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example of how you might create and use it in your main application file (src/main.ts)\n// import { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md';\n// import { InputController } from './input_controller.ts'; // Assuming this file exists\n\n// const myPuzzleEngine = new PuzzleEngine(somePuzzleConfiguration); // Imagine this is set up\n// const myInputController = new InputController(myPuzzleEngine);\n// myInputController.startListening(); // A method to start the listeners if not in constructor\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine)`**: When we create an `InputController`, we give it a reference to our `PuzzleEngine`. This is crucial because the `Input Controller` needs to *tell* the engine about player actions.\n2.  **`document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener(...)`**: This is how web applications listen for user interactions. We're saying, \"Hey browser, whenever someone clicks on the HTML element with the ID 'game-board', please run our `handleClick` function.\"\n3.  **`handleClick(event: MouseEvent)`**: This function is called every time a click occurs on the game board.\n    *   `event: MouseEvent` contains details about the click, like where on the screen it happened.\n    *   `const clickedRow = 0; const clickedCol = 0;` (Simplified): In a real game, we'd use the `event` data and knowledge of our [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)'s layout to precisely determine which [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked. For this example, we're just hardcoding it to `(0,0)` to keep it simple.\n    *   **`this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);`**: This is the most important part! The `Input Controller` doesn't *do* the game logic itself. It simply translates the player's action into a command and passes it to the `Puzzle Engine`, which is responsible for processing game rules and updating the game state.\n\n### The Flow of an Input\n\nLet's visualize the journey of a player's click through our system:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as Game UI (HTML)\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on a puzzle slot (e.g., a square on screen)\n    UI->>IC: Notifies of click event (e.g., \"click at x=100, y=50\")\n    IC->>IC: Determines which Puzzle Slot was clicked (e.g., \"slot at row 1, col 2\")\n    IC->>PE: Sends \"SlotClicked\" command (e.g., \"slot(1, 2) clicked\")\n    PE->>GGS: Updates Game Grid State based on game rules\n    GGS-->>PE: State updated (e.g., \"slot(1,2) now contains 'X'\")\n    PE-->>IC: (Optional) Acknowledges or provides feedback\n    IC-->>UI: (Optional) Triggers UI update to show new game state\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `Input Controller` acts as the crucial intermediary. It takes raw user input, makes sense of it in the context of our game, and then hands off a clear instruction to the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Input Controller` is a vital component that bridges the gap between the player and the game's internal logic. It listens for player actions, translates them into game-specific commands, and then passes these commands to the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) for processing. Without it, our beautifully configured puzzles and powerful engine would remain untouched and unplayable. It's what makes our game interactive and fun!\n\nNext, we'll shift gears from playing the game to *creating* the game. We'll explore the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), which is a visual tool designed to help puzzle creators build and configure new puzzles using all the concepts we've learned so far.",
          "# Chapter 6: Puzzle Editor UI\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](05_input_controller.md), we explored the `Input Controller`, which is all about how players interact with an *already existing* puzzle game – clicking, dragging, and making moves. It's the bridge between a player's actions and the game's logic.\n\nBut what if you want to create a *brand new* puzzle? How do you design the starting layout, decide which slots are empty, or place specific items? That's where the `Puzzle Editor UI` comes in!\n\n### The Puzzle Designer's Workbench\n\nImagine you're not just a player, but a puzzle designer. You have an idea for a challenging new puzzle. You need a tool, a \"workbench,\" where you can visually lay out your puzzle, slot by slot, until it looks just right. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is exactly that workbench.\n\nIts main job is to provide a friendly visual interface that allows you to easily create and modify a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md). Remember, the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) is the blueprint for a puzzle – it defines its initial state and rules. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is the tool you use to *draw* that blueprint.\n\n**Use Case**: Let's say you want to design a simple 2x2 puzzle. You want the top-left slot to contain a 'star', the top-right to be 'empty', the bottom-left to contain a 'circle', and the bottom-right to be 'empty'. The `Puzzle Editor UI` lets you click on a visual grid and assign these values, then save your creation.\n\n### What is a UI? (User Interface)\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's quickly clarify \"UI.\" UI stands for **User Interface**. It's simply anything you see and interact with on a screen – buttons, menus, text fields, and in our case, a visual representation of a puzzle grid. It's how a human tells a computer what to do, and how the computer shows information back to the human.\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is the visual part of our system that lets you \"talk\" to the puzzle creation process.\n\n### How the Puzzle Editor UI Works\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` essentially does two main things:\n\n1.  **Visualizes a Puzzle**: It displays a grid, much like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), but for editing purposes. Each square in this grid represents a potential [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n2.  **Allows Interaction**: You can click on these squares (slots) to change what they contain (e.g., from empty to a star, or a circle). It also provides buttons to save your work.\n\nWhen you save your puzzle in the editor, it takes all your visual choices and packages them up into a structured data format – specifically, a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object. This object can then be used by the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to run the game, or by the [HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md) to create a playable version.\n\n#### Step-by-Step: Designing a Puzzle\n\nLet's walk through how you'd use the `Puzzle Editor UI` to create our 2x2 puzzle:\n\n1.  **Open the Editor**: You'd launch the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It might show you an empty grid or load a previously saved puzzle.\n2.  **See the Grid**: The UI displays a grid of editable [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n    *(Imagine this is a visual grid in your browser)*\n3.  **Click to Edit**: You click on the top-left slot. A small menu might pop up, or the slot might cycle through different types (empty, star, circle). You select 'star'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n4.  **Continue Editing**: You click the bottom-left slot and select 'circle'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    | ● |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n5.  **Save Your Work**: Once you're happy with your design, you click a \"Save Puzzle\" button.\n\nWhat happens behind the scenes when you click \"Save\"? The `Puzzle Editor UI` gathers all the information about your visually designed grid and converts it into a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) data structure.\n\nHere's a simplified example of what that saved configuration might look like (as we discussed in [Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)):\n\n```javascript\n// This is the Puzzle Configuration generated by the UI\nconst myNewPuzzleConfig = {\n  id: \"my-first-2x2-puzzle\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  // ... other rules and settings (simplified for example)\n};\n```\n**Output**: The `Puzzle Editor UI` doesn't output a visual, but rather a data structure (like the `myNewPuzzleConfig` above) that describes your puzzle. This data can then be stored and used later.\n\n### Under the Hood: How the Editor Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `Puzzle Editor UI` manages to turn your clicks into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\n#### The Editor's Internal Process\n\nWhen you interact with the `Puzzle Editor UI`, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant EditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant InternalGridData as Editor's Internal Grid Data\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration (File/Object)\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 1. Opens Editor\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 2. Initializes/Loads blank grid\n    EditorUI-->>User: 3. Displays empty grid\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 4. Clicks on a slot (e.g., top-left)\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 5. Updates internal data for that slot (e.g., \"star\")\n    EditorUI-->>User: 6. Updates visual display of the slot\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 7. Clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\n    EditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: 8. Converts InternalGridData to Puzzle Configuration format\n    PuzzleConfig-->>EditorUI: 9. Returns generated config data\n    EditorUI-->>User: 10. Confirms puzzle saved\n```\n\n1.  **Initialization**: When you open the editor, it creates an internal representation of the puzzle grid. This is like a temporary scratchpad where it keeps track of what you're designing.\n2.  **User Interaction**: When you click a slot, the `Puzzle Editor UI` updates this internal scratchpad. It doesn't immediately create a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) file; it just notes down your changes.\n3.  **Saving**: Only when you click \"Save\" does the `Puzzle Editor UI` take everything on its scratchpad and carefully package it into the official [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) format. This format is what the rest of our system understands.\n\n#### Simplified Code Example (Internal Logic)\n\nLet's imagine a very basic way the `Puzzle Editor UI` might manage its internal grid data and then generate a configuration.\n\nFirst, the editor needs a way to store the current state of the puzzle being designed. This could be a simple array of arrays, similar to how `initialState` is represented in a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md):\n\n```javascript\n// Inside the Puzzle Editor UI's logic\nlet currentEditorGrid = [\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"],\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"]\n];\n\n// This represents the 2x2 grid the user sees and interacts with.\n```\nWhen a user clicks on a slot, the editor updates this `currentEditorGrid`. For instance, if the user clicks the top-left slot (row 0, column 0) and sets it to 'star':\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when a user clicks a slot in the UI\nfunction updateSlotInEditor(row, col, value) {\n  currentEditorGrid[row][col] = value;\n  console.log(`Slot (${row}, ${col}) updated to: ${value}`);\n  // The UI would then visually update the displayed slot\n}\n\n// Example: User sets top-left to 'star'\nupdateSlotInEditor(0, 0, \"star\");\n// Example: User sets bottom-left to 'circle'\nupdateSlotInEditor(1, 0, \"circle\");\n\n// currentEditorGrid is now:\n// [\n//   [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n//   [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n// ]\n```\n**Output**: The `console.log` shows the internal update. Visually, the editor would change the appearance of the clicked slot.\n\nFinally, when the user clicks \"Save,\" the `Puzzle Editor UI` takes this `currentEditorGrid` and wraps it into a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object:\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when the user clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\nfunction generatePuzzleConfiguration() {\n  const rows = currentEditorGrid.length;\n  const cols = currentEditorGrid[0].length;\n\n  const newConfig = {\n    id: \"user-designed-puzzle-\" + Date.now(), // Unique ID\n    gridSize: { rows: rows, cols: cols },\n    initialState: currentEditorGrid,\n    // Add other default rules or settings here\n    rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n  };\n\n  console.log(\"Generated Puzzle Configuration:\", newConfig);\n  // This 'newConfig' would then be saved to a file or database.\n  return newConfig;\n}\n\nconst savedConfig = generatePuzzleConfiguration();\n```\n**Output**:\n```\nGenerated Puzzle Configuration: {\n  id: \"user-designed-puzzle-...\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n}\n```\nThis `newConfig` is the valuable output of the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It's a complete blueprint ready for the game!\n\nWhile the `src/config.ts` file (which might contain general settings like `port` or `database`) isn't directly involved in the *logic* of generating a puzzle configuration, a real-world `Puzzle Editor UI` might use such a configuration file to know *where* to save the generated puzzle configurations (e.g., to a specific database or API endpoint).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is your creative hub for designing new puzzles. It provides a visual interface to interact with and modify the layout of a puzzle grid. By clicking and selecting items for individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, you build up your desired puzzle. When you save, the editor translates your visual design into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object, which is the blueprint for any new puzzle. It's the essential tool for anyone who wants to move beyond playing and start creating!\n\nNow that we know how to *create* a puzzle's blueprint using the `Puzzle Editor UI`, the next logical step is to turn that blueprint into a playable game that someone can actually see and interact with in a web browser. In our next chapter, we'll explore the `HTML Game Generator`, which takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and builds the actual web page for the game.\n\n[Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md)",
          "# Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), we explored the `Puzzle Editor UI`. That's where you, the game designer, get to be creative – dragging, dropping, and arranging elements to craft amazing new puzzles. You learned how to define the starting layout and rules, essentially creating a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\nBut once you've designed a masterpiece in the editor, what's next? How do you let someone *play* your game without them needing to open the editor themselves? How do you share your creation with friends, or even upload it to a website?\n\nThis is exactly the problem the `HTML Game Generator` solves! It's like taking your carefully prepared puzzle recipe (the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) and baking it into a delicious, ready-to-eat cake (a standalone HTML game file) that anyone can enjoy with just a web browser.\n\n### What is the HTML Game Generator?\n\nAt its core, the `HTML Game Generator` is a special tool that takes all the information about your puzzle – its size, initial items, and rules (your [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) – and packages it into a single, self-contained `.html` file. This file contains everything needed to play the game:\n\n*   The puzzle's data.\n*   The game's logic (like the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) and [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n*   The visual presentation (HTML and CSS).\n\nThink of it as a \"game exporter.\" You design the puzzle, and the generator creates the playable version.\n\n### Why Do We Need It?\n\nImagine you've spent hours crafting a challenging new puzzle. You want to share it!\n\n*   **For Players**: Players don't need to see the complex editor. They just want to click a file and start playing. The `HTML Game Generator` provides this simple, direct experience.\n*   **For Sharing**: You can send a single `.html` file to a friend, and they can open it in Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser. No installation, no special software needed!\n*   **For Deployment**: If you want to put your game on a website, you can simply upload the generated HTML file.\n\nWithout the `HTML Game Generator`, your amazing puzzles would be stuck inside the editor, unable to be easily shared or played by others.\n\n### How It Works: The Big Picture\n\nThe process is quite straightforward:\n\n1.  You provide the `HTML Game Generator` with a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n2.  It takes a basic HTML template (like a blank canvas for a web page).\n3.  It then \"fills in\" this template by embedding your puzzle's data directly into the HTML.\n4.  It also adds all the necessary JavaScript code for the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) (to run the game logic) and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (to handle player clicks/drags).\n5.  Finally, it gives you back a single string of text, which is the complete HTML content for your game. You can then save this string to a `.html` file.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Puzzle Configuration] --> B{HTML Game Generator};\n    C[HTML Template] --> B;\n    D[Game Logic (JS/CSS)] --> B;\n    B --> E[Generated HTML File];\n```\n\n### Using the HTML Game Generator\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how you might use this generator. Imagine you have a `puzzleConfig` object, which is the result of your work in the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) and contains all the details of your puzzle.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is our Puzzle Configuration data,\n// created by the Puzzle Editor UI (Chapter 6)\nconst myPuzzleConfig = {\n  gridSize: { rows: 3, cols: 3 },\n  initialState: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    { x: 1, y: 0, type: 'block' },\n    { x: 2, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    // ... more puzzle slot data ...\n  ],\n  rules: [\n    { type: 'move', condition: 'adjacent', action: 'swap' }\n    // ... more rules ...\n  ]\n};\n\n// This function would be part of our HTML Game Generator\nfunction generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n  // Internally, this function builds a big HTML string.\n  // For this example, we'll just show a simplified output.\n  return `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n    const initialConfig = ${JSON.stringify(config)};\n    // ... game engine and input controller code would go here ...\n  </script></body></html>`;\n}\n\n// Now, let's generate the HTML for our puzzle!\nconst gameHtmlContent = generateGameHtml(myPuzzleConfig);\n\nconsole.log(\"Generated HTML starts with:\", gameHtmlContent.substring(0, 100));\n// Output: Generated HTML starts with: <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n//         const initialConfig = {\n```\n\nIn this example, `generateGameHtml` takes your `myPuzzleConfig` and returns a long string that represents a complete HTML file. You would then save this string to a file named `my_awesome_puzzle.html`, and anyone could open it in their browser to play!\n\n### Under the Hood: How It Generates the HTML\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `HTML Game Generator` actually constructs that HTML file. It's like a chef assembling a meal: they start with a plate (the HTML template), add the main dish (your puzzle data), and then add the sauces and garnishes (the game logic scripts).\n\nHere's a step-by-step flow of what happens:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Caller as Puzzle Editor UI (or similar)\n    participant HGG as HTML Game Generator\n    participant Template as HTML Template File\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant GameScripts as Game Logic Scripts\n    participant Output as Generated HTML String\n\n    Caller->>HGG: Request game HTML (puzzleConfig)\n    HGG->>Template: Read base HTML structure\n    HGG->>PC: Get serialized puzzle data (JSON)\n    HGG->>GameScripts: Read Puzzle Engine & Input Controller code\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed puzzle data into template\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed game scripts into template\n    HGG->>Output: Return complete HTML string\n    Output-->>Caller: HTML content ready\n```\n\nLet's look at a simplified conceptual code snippet that shows how this might work:\n\n```typescript\n// src/htmlGameGenerator.ts (Conceptual)\n\n// Imagine this is a basic HTML structure with placeholders\n// for where our puzzle data and game scripts will go.\nconst baseHtmlTemplate = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Generated Puzzle Game</title>\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: sans-serif; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; margin: 0; background-color: #f0f0f0; }\n        #game-container { border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; background-color: white; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game-container\">\n        <!-- The game will render here -->\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        // This is where our puzzle configuration will be injected!\n        const initialPuzzleConfig = {{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}};\n    </script>\n    <script>{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n`;\n\n// In a real system, these functions would read actual JavaScript files\n// containing the code for the Puzzle Engine and Input Controller.\nfunction getGameEngineScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n    return `\n        // Simplified Puzzle Engine code\n        class PuzzleEngine {\n            constructor(config) { console.log(\"Engine initialized with config:\", config); }\n            applyMove(state, move) { console.log(\"Applying move:\", move); return state; }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\nfunction getInputControllerScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 5: Input Controller\n    return `\n        // Simplified Input Controller code\n        class InputController {\n            constructor(gameElement, engine) {\n                console.log(\"Input Controller ready for:\", gameElement);\n                gameElement.addEventListener('click', () => engine.applyMove({}, 'click'));\n            }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\n// This is the main function of our HTML Game Generator\nexport function generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n    // 1. Convert the puzzle configuration object into a JSON string.\n    //    This makes it easy to embed directly into JavaScript.\n    const configJson = JSON.stringify(config, null, 2); // 'null, 2' makes it nicely formatted\n\n    // 2. Gather all the necessary game logic scripts.\n    //    This includes the Puzzle Engine, Input Controller, and any\n    //    code to actually start the game.\n    const allGameScripts = `\n        ${getGameEngineScript()}\n        ${getInputControllerScript()}\n\n        // Code to initialize and start the game when the page loads\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n            const gameContainer = document.getElementById('game-container');\n            const engine = new PuzzleEngine(initialPuzzleConfig);\n            new InputController(gameContainer, engine);\n            console.log(\"Game started!\");\n            // In a real game, the engine would render the initial state here\n        });\n    `;\n\n    // 3. Replace the placeholders in our base HTML template\n    //    with the actual puzzle data and game scripts.\n    let finalHtml = baseHtmlTemplate\n        .replace('{{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}}', configJson)\n        .replace('{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}', allGameScripts);\n\n    return finalHtml;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `generateGameHtml` function acts as an assembler. It takes your puzzle's blueprint (`config`), fetches the standard parts (template, engine code, input code), and then carefully puts them all together into a single, functional HTML file.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `HTML Game Generator`, a vital component that bridges the gap between designing a puzzle and playing it. We learned that:\n\n*   It takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) (the rules and initial state of your puzzle).\n*   It combines this data with a basic HTML structure, the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) logic, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) code.\n*   The result is a single, standalone `.html` file that can be opened in any web browser, making your puzzle playable and easily shareable.\n\nThis concludes our journey through the core components of our puzzle game system! We've covered everything from the smallest building block, the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md), to how the entire game is packaged for players. You now have a solid understanding of how these pieces work together to create a complete and interactive puzzle experience."

          "# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\nWelcome to the first chapter of our journey into understanding how our puzzle game system works! We're going to start with a fundamental building block: the `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n### Project Summary\n\nBefore we dive in, here's a quick overview of the main components we'll be exploring throughout this tutorial:\n\n*   **Puzzle Configuration**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Configuration and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Engine**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Engine and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Slot**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Slot and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Game Grid State**: A comprehensive overview of Game Grid State and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Editor UI**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Editor UI and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **HTML Game Generator**: A comprehensive overview of HTML Game Generator and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Input Controller**: A comprehensive overview of Input Controller and its role in the system architecture.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\n### What Problem Does \"Puzzle Slot\" Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game like Sudoku, a sliding block puzzle, or even a simple tic-tac-toe. All these games happen on a grid, right? Each square on that grid can either be empty, or it can hold a specific piece (like a number in Sudoku, a block in a sliding puzzle, or an 'X'/'O' in tic-tac-toe).\n\nHow do we represent these individual squares in our code? How do we keep track of what's in each one, and where it is on the board? This is exactly the problem the `Puzzle Slot` abstraction solves!\n\nThink of a `Puzzle Slot` as a single, individual square on your game board. It's like one cell in a spreadsheet, but for your game. Each `Puzzle Slot` knows its exact position and what's currently inside it.\n\n#### Use Case: Building a Simple Block Puzzle\n\nLet's say we're building a simple puzzle game where players move colored blocks around a grid. Our game board is a 3x3 grid.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n| R | B |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   | G | R |\n+---+---+---+\n| B |   | G |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nIn this example:\n*   The top-left square contains a Red block.\n*   The top-right square is empty.\n*   The middle-center square contains a Green block.\n\nEach of these nine squares would be represented by a `Puzzle Slot`. A `Puzzle Slot` helps us answer questions like:\n1.  What's at position `(0, 0)` (top-left)? (Answer: A Red block)\n2.  Is position `(0, 2)` (top-right) empty? (Answer: Yes)\n3.  What color block is at position `(1, 1)` (middle-center)? (Answer: Green)\n\n### The Core Idea: What is a Puzzle Slot?\n\nAt its heart, a `Puzzle Slot` is a simple data container. It holds information about a single position on your game grid.\n\nHere are the key pieces of information a `Puzzle Slot` typically stores:\n\n1.  **Location**: Where is this slot on the grid? This is usually represented by `x` and `y` coordinates (or `row` and `column`).\n2.  **Content**: What is currently occupying this slot? Is it empty? Does it hold a specific puzzle piece, a number, a color, or some other game element?\n3.  **Properties (Optional)**: Does this slot have any special rules or characteristics? For example, is it a \"fixed\" slot that the player can't change? Is it a \"goal\" slot that a specific piece needs to reach?\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleSlot {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string content\n        +boolean isFixed\n    }\n```\n*This diagram shows that a `Puzzle Slot` is like a blueprint for an object that has an `x` coordinate, a `y` coordinate, some `content` (like \"Red Block\" or \"empty\"), and a flag `isFixed` to say if it can be changed.*\n\n### How We Use Puzzle Slots\n\nIn our system, `Puzzle Slot` objects are created to represent every single position on the game board. They are then organized and managed by other parts of the system, like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which keeps track of all the slots together to form the complete board.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how you might define a `Puzzle Slot` in code. Remember, we're keeping it super minimal to focus on the core idea!\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleSlot.ts (Conceptual file)\n\ninterface PuzzleSlot {\n  x: number; // The column on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  y: number; // The row on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  content: string | null; // What's in this slot? 'Red Block', 'Blue Block', or null if empty\n  isFixed: boolean; // Can the player change this slot?\n}\n\n// Example of creating a Puzzle Slot\nconst topLeftSlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  content: \"Red Block\",\n  isFixed: false, // Player can move this block\n};\n\nconst emptySlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 2,\n  content: null, // This slot is empty\n  isFixed: false,\n};\n\nconsole.log(topLeftSlot);\n// Output: { x: 0, y: 0, content: 'Red Block', isFixed: false }\n```\n*In this example, we define what a `PuzzleSlot` looks like using an `interface`. Then, we create two example `PuzzleSlot` objects. One holds a \"Red Block\" at `(0,0)`, and another is `empty` at `(0,2)`. Notice how `content` can be `null` to indicate emptiness.*\n\nThis simple structure allows us to describe any square on our puzzle board.\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Slots Work\n\nA `Puzzle Slot` itself doesn't perform complex actions. It's primarily a data structure. Its main job is to *hold* information. Other parts of our system then *read* from and *write* to these `Puzzle Slot` objects.\n\nFor instance, when the game needs to know what's at a specific position, it will ask the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) for the `Puzzle Slot` at those coordinates, and then read its `content`. When a player makes a move, the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) might tell the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to update the `content` of a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\nLet's imagine a very simple flow for how a `Puzzle Slot`'s content might be accessed:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant InputController\n    participant GameGridState\n    participant PuzzleSlot\n\n    Player->>InputController: Tries to move block to (1,1)\n    InputController->>GameGridState: Get slot at (1,1)\n    GameGridState->>PuzzleSlot: What is your content?\n    PuzzleSlot-->>GameGridState: \"Green Block\"\n    GameGridState-->>InputController: Slot (1,1) has \"Green Block\"\n    InputController->>Player: (Decides if move is valid based on content)\n```\n*This sequence diagram shows how a player's action (trying to move a block) eventually leads to the `GameGridState` asking a specific `PuzzleSlot` for its `content`. The `PuzzleSlot` simply provides the data it holds.*\n\nThe `Puzzle Slot` is a foundational piece of data that many other parts of our system rely on. It's like a single brick in a wall – it doesn't build the house, but it's essential for the wall to exist.\n\nWhile the `src/utils.ts` file you saw in the project context contains general utility functions like `formatDate`, it doesn't directly define or manipulate `Puzzle Slot` objects. `Puzzle Slot` definitions would typically reside in a file dedicated to game data structures, like `src/puzzleSlot.ts` (as shown in our conceptual example).\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that a `Puzzle Slot` is a fundamental building block for our puzzle game. It represents a single position on the game board, storing its location, what's inside it, and any special properties it might have. It's a simple data container that helps us describe the state of our game grid.\n\nUnderstanding `Puzzle Slot` is crucial because it's the smallest unit of our game board. In the next chapter, we'll see how these individual `Puzzle Slot`s are brought together to form the complete game board. We'll explore the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which is responsible for managing all the `Puzzle Slot`s and providing a complete picture of the puzzle board at any given moment.\n\nReady to see how all these individual squares form a complete puzzle? Let's move on!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)",
          "# Chapter 2: Game Grid State\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](01_puzzle_slot.md), we explored the `Puzzle Slot`, which is like a single, individual container on our puzzle board. It knows what's inside itself, but it doesn't know anything about its neighbors or the puzzle as a whole.\n\nToday, we're going to zoom out and look at the bigger picture: the `Game Grid State`. If a `Puzzle Slot` is one brick, the `Game Grid State` is the blueprint and current status of the entire wall built from those bricks!\n\n### What Problem Does Game Grid State Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a Sudoku game. You've placed a '5' in one square, a '2' in another, and so on. How does the game know:\n1.  What number is in *every* square?\n2.  If you've made a mistake (e.g., two '5's in the same row)?\n3.  If you've finally completed the puzzle?\n\nThe answer to all these questions lies with the `Game Grid State`. It's the central brain that keeps track of the *entire* puzzle board at any given moment. It holds all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and knows what's inside each one.\n\nOur central use case for this chapter is: **How does the game keep track of all the pieces on the board and update them when a player makes a move?** The `Game Grid State` is designed precisely for this!\n\n### What is Game Grid State?\n\nThink of the `Game Grid State` as a digital map or a spreadsheet of your entire puzzle board. Each cell in this spreadsheet corresponds to a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n\nIt's a single object that contains and manages all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s that make up your puzzle. When you look at the `Game Grid State`, you should be able to tell exactly what's happening on every part of your board.\n\nHere's a simple way to visualize it:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Game Grid State] --> B[Puzzle Slot (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Puzzle Slot (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Puzzle Slot (1,0)]\n    A --> E[Puzzle Slot (1,1)]\n    A --- F[...]\n    F --> G[Puzzle Slot (N,M)]\n\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nIn this diagram, `Game Grid State` is the overarching container, and it holds many individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, each identified by its position (like `(0,0)` for top-left, `(0,1)` for top-middle, etc.).\n\n### How to Use Game Grid State: Updating the Board\n\nLet's go back to our use case: a player makes a move. For example, they place a 'circle' piece into the top-left slot of a 2x2 grid. How does the `Game Grid State` handle this?\n\nThe `Game Grid State` provides methods to interact with the slots it manages. You tell it *which* slot to update (using its row and column) and *what* new content to put there.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might create a `GameGridState` and update one of its slots:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of your game logic\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We're using the PuzzleSlot from Chapter 1!\n\nclass GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // A 2D array to hold all our Puzzle Slots\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = [];\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = [];\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new, empty PuzzleSlot\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us update the content of a specific slot\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        // We'll look at the internal details of this method next!\n        console.log(`Request to update slot at (${row},${col}) with: ${newContent}`);\n        // ... internal logic to find and update the slot ...\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us see what's inside a specific slot\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        // ... internal logic to find and return slot content ...\n        return \"Current Content\"; // Placeholder\n    }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\nconst myGameGrid = new GameGridState(2, 2); // Create a 2x2 puzzle grid\n\nconsole.log(\"Initial content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: Initial content of (0,0): Current Content (or whatever PuzzleSlot defaults to)\n\nmyGameGrid.updateSlotContent(0, 0, \"Circle\"); // Player places a 'Circle' in the top-left slot\n// Output: Request to update slot at (0,0) with: Circle\n\nconsole.log(\"New content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: New content of (0,0): Circle (after the update)\n```\n**Explanation:**\n1.  We create an instance of `GameGridState`, specifying its size (e.g., 2 rows, 2 columns).\n2.  When `updateSlotContent` is called, we tell the `GameGridState` exactly *where* (row 0, column 0) and *what* (\"Circle\") to place.\n3.  The `GameGridState` then takes care of finding the correct [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) and updating its content.\n\n### Internal Implementation: What's Under the Hood?\n\nHow does `GameGridState` actually manage all those [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and update them? Let's peek behind the curtain.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Process\n\nWhen a player makes a move, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PS as Puzzle Slot\n\n    Player->>IC: Clicks on slot (0,0) to place 'X'\n    IC->>GGS: Request: updateSlotContent(0,0, \"X\")\n    GGS->>GGS: Finds the Puzzle Slot at (0,0)\n    GGS->>PS: Calls PS.setContent(\"X\")\n    PS-->>GGS: Slot content updated\n    GGS-->>IC: Update successful\n    IC-->>Player: Shows 'X' on the screen\n```\n\n1.  **Player Interaction**: The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a square on the screen).\n2.  **Input Controller**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (which we'll cover in a later chapter) detects this interaction and translates it into a meaningful action, like \"update slot (0,0) with 'X'\".\n3.  **Game Grid State Request**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) then tells the `Game Grid State` to perform this update.\n4.  **Finding the Slot**: The `Game Grid State` looks through its internal collection of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s to find the one at the specified coordinates (0,0).\n5.  **Updating the Slot**: Once found, the `Game Grid State` doesn't change the content itself. Instead, it asks the specific [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) object to update *its own* content using its `setContent` method (as discussed in [Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)).\n6.  **Confirmation & Display**: The `Game Grid State` confirms the update, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (or another component like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md)) updates the visual display for the player.\n\n#### Code Deep Dive\n\nLet's look at a more complete (but still simplified) version of our `GameGridState` class, imagining it lives in a file like `src/gameGridState.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameGridState.ts\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We import our PuzzleSlot class\n\nexport class GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // This is where we store all our PuzzleSlot objects\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = []; // Create a new row\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new PuzzleSlot instance\n                // and place it in our grid. Each slot starts empty.\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(`Game Grid State initialized with ${rows} rows and ${cols} columns.`);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the PuzzleSlot object at a specific grid position.\n     * This is an internal helper method.\n     */\n    private getSlot(row: number, col: number): PuzzleSlot | undefined {\n        // Check if the requested coordinates are within our grid boundaries\n        if (row >= 0 && row < this.slots.length && col >= 0 && col < this.slots[0].length) {\n            return this.slots[row][col]; // Return the PuzzleSlot object\n        }\n        return undefined; // If out of bounds, return nothing\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Updates the content of a specific PuzzleSlot on the grid.\n     * This is the method external parts of the game would call.\n     */\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col); // Find the correct PuzzleSlot\n        if (targetSlot) {\n            targetSlot.setContent(newContent); // Ask the PuzzleSlot to update itself\n            console.log(`Updated slot at (${row},${col}) with: \"${newContent}\"`);\n        } else {\n            console.warn(`Cannot update: Slot at (${row},${col}) does not exist.`);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Gets the current content of a specific PuzzleSlot.\n     */\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col);\n        return targetSlot ? targetSlot.getContent() : undefined; // Ask the PuzzleSlot for its content\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation:**\n*   **`slots: PuzzleSlot[][]`**: This is the core of `GameGridState`. It's a 2D array (an array of arrays) where each element is an actual `PuzzleSlot` object. This structure perfectly mirrors a grid.\n*   **`constructor(rows, cols)`**: When you create a `GameGridState`, you tell it how big the grid should be. It then loops through each position and creates a new, empty `PuzzleSlot` for it.\n*   **`private getSlot(row, col)`**: This is a helper method (marked `private` because it's mainly for internal use within `GameGridState`). It safely retrieves a `PuzzleSlot` object from the `slots` array based on its coordinates, making sure you don't ask for a slot that doesn't exist.\n*   **`updateSlotContent(row, col, newContent)`**: This is the public method used to change a slot. It first uses `getSlot` to find the right `PuzzleSlot` and then calls that `PuzzleSlot`'s `setContent` method. Notice how `GameGridState` *delegates* the actual content management to the `PuzzleSlot` itself.\n*   **`getSlotContent(row, col)`**: Similarly, this method retrieves the content by asking the specific `PuzzleSlot` for its content using `getContent`.\n\nThis design keeps things organized: `GameGridState` knows *where* all the slots are and how to access them, while each `PuzzleSlot` knows *what* it contains.\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that the `Game Grid State` is the central manager for all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s on our puzzle board. It provides a way to:\n*   Represent the entire puzzle board.\n*   Access and update the content of any specific slot.\n*   Keep track of the current state of the game.\n\nIt's the \"big picture\" that allows our game to understand the overall layout and progress.\n\nNow that we know how to manage the *current* state of our puzzle, a natural question arises: How do we define what the puzzle *should* look like initially? How do we set up the rules or the starting pieces? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)!",
          "# Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](02_game_grid_state.md), we learned about the `Game Grid State`, which is like the current snapshot of our puzzle board – what's in each slot right now. Before that, in [Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md), we met the individual `Puzzle Slot`s, the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to tackle a crucial concept: the `Puzzle Configuration`. If the `Game Grid State` tells us what the puzzle *currently looks like*, the `Puzzle Configuration` tells us *how to build* a specific puzzle from scratch. Think of it as the blueprint or the recipe for a particular puzzle level.\n\n### What Problem Does Puzzle Configuration Solve?\n\nImagine you're designing a new puzzle for our game. You need to decide:\n*   How big should the puzzle board be? (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)\n*   What items should be in each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) when the puzzle starts?\n*   What are the rules for winning this specific puzzle?\n\nWithout a `Puzzle Configuration`, every time you wanted to play a specific puzzle, you'd have to manually set up the board, place all the items, and remember the winning conditions. That's a lot of work and prone to errors!\n\nThe `Puzzle Configuration` solves this by acting as a single, organized place to store *all* the information needed to define a unique puzzle level. It's like a recipe card for a specific cake: it lists all the ingredients, their quantities, and the baking instructions, so anyone can make that exact cake again and again.\n\n### What's Inside a Puzzle Configuration?\n\nA `Puzzle Configuration` holds all the essential details that make one puzzle different from another. Here are the key pieces of information it typically contains:\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions**: The width and height of the puzzle board.\n2.  **Initial Slot Contents**: For each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) on the grid, what item (if any) should it contain when the puzzle begins?\n3.  **Winning Conditions**: What needs to happen for the player to win this puzzle? (e.g., \"all slots must be empty,\" \"specific slots must contain specific items,\" \"a certain pattern must be formed\").\n\nLet's visualize this relationship:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleConfiguration {\n        +int width\n        +int height\n        +List~SlotDefinition~ initialSlots\n        +WinningCondition winningCondition\n    }\n    class SlotDefinition {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string initialItem\n    }\n    class WinningCondition {\n        +string type\n        +object details\n    }\n\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"*\" SlotDefinition : defines initial state for\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"1\" WinningCondition : specifies\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   `PuzzleConfiguration` is our main concept.\n*   It has `width` and `height` to define the grid size.\n*   `initialSlots` is a list of `SlotDefinition`s. Each `SlotDefinition` tells us what should be in a specific `(x, y)` coordinate at the start. This is how we define the initial state of our [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n*   `WinningCondition` describes what makes the puzzle complete.\n\n### How to Define a Puzzle Configuration\n\nLet's say we want to create a very simple 2x2 puzzle. We want it to start with an \"A\" in the top-left corner and an \"B\" in the top-right, with the rest empty. The winning condition is that all slots must be empty.\n\nHere's how we might define this `Puzzle Configuration` in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// Example: Defining a simple 2x2 puzzle configuration\nconst simplePuzzleConfig = {\n  width: 2,\n  height: 2,\n  initialSlots: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, item: \"A\" }, // Top-left slot has 'A'\n    { x: 1, y: 0, item: \"B\" }  // Top-right slot has 'B'\n    // Other slots (0,1) and (1,1) are implicitly empty\n  ],\n  winningCondition: {\n    type: \"all_empty\" // Player wins when all slots are empty\n  }\n};\n\nconsole.log(\"Defined a puzzle configuration:\", simplePuzzleConfig);\n// Output: Defined a puzzle configuration: { width: 2, height: 2, ... }\n```\n\nThis `simplePuzzleConfig` object is now a complete \"recipe\" for our 2x2 puzzle. It's a data structure that can be saved, loaded, and shared. When our game starts, it can read this configuration to set up the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Configuration is Used\n\nSo, we have this `Puzzle Configuration` object. How does the system actually use it to create a playable puzzle?\n\nThink of it as a sequence of events:\n\n1.  **Design**: A puzzle designer (or you, using a tool like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) later) creates a `Puzzle Configuration`.\n2.  **Save/Load**: This configuration is saved (e.g., to a file) and can be loaded by the game.\n3.  **Initialization**: When a player selects a puzzle level, the game loads its corresponding `Puzzle Configuration`.\n4.  **Setup**: The `Puzzle Engine` (which we'll explore in the next chapter!) reads this configuration and uses it to build the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). It creates all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, places the initial items, and stores the winning conditions.\n\nHere's a simplified sequence diagram showing this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant PuzzleEditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant PuzzleEngine as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GameGridState as Game Grid State\n\n    User->>PuzzleEditorUI: Designs a new puzzle\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: Creates/updates configuration data\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEditorUI: Returns configuration\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>User: Saves puzzle level\n\n    User->>PuzzleEngine: Selects a puzzle level\n    PuzzleEngine->>PuzzleConfig: Loads configuration for level\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEngine: Provides configuration data\n    PuzzleEngine->>GameGridState: Initializes grid based on config\n    GameGridState-->>PuzzleEngine: Initial grid ready\n    PuzzleEngine->>User: Presents playable puzzle\n```\n\nIn this flow, the `Puzzle Configuration` acts as the bridge between the puzzle's design and its actual playable state. It's a static description that the dynamic parts of our system (like the `Puzzle Engine` and `Game Grid State`) use to come to life.\n\n### A Glimpse at the Code Structure\n\nWhile the exact implementation can vary, a `Puzzle Configuration` might be represented by a class or an interface that ensures all necessary information is present.\n\nLet's imagine a basic `PuzzleConfiguration` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzle-config.ts (conceptual file)\n\n// Defines what an individual slot should contain initially\ninterface SlotDefinition {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n  item: string | null; // 'null' means empty\n}\n\n// Defines the winning condition for a puzzle\ninterface WinningCondition {\n  type: \"all_empty\" | \"match_pattern\"; // Example types\n  // ... other details based on type\n}\n\nexport class PuzzleConfiguration {\n  readonly width: number;\n  readonly height: number;\n  readonly initialSlots: SlotDefinition[];\n  readonly winningCondition: WinningCondition;\n\n  constructor(width: number, height: number, initialSlots: SlotDefinition[], winningCondition: WinningCondition) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    this.initialSlots = initialSlots;\n    this.winningCondition = winningCondition;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis `PuzzleConfiguration` class provides a structured way to hold all the \"recipe\" information. When the game needs to start a new level, it creates an instance of this class, populating it with the specific details for that level. The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this instance and uses its `width`, `height`, and `initialSlots` to construct the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) with all its [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s correctly set up.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the `Puzzle Configuration`, the essential blueprint for any puzzle level in our game. We learned that it defines the puzzle's dimensions, its starting layout of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, and its winning conditions. It's the static data that brings a specific puzzle to life, acting as a recipe for the dynamic [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\nNow that we know how a puzzle is *defined*, the next logical step is to understand how it actually *runs*! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), which is responsible for taking a `Puzzle Configuration` and making it an interactive, playable experience.",
          "# Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](03_puzzle_configuration.md), we learned about the `Puzzle Configuration`, which is like the rulebook and initial setup instructions for our puzzle game. Before that, we explored the `Game Grid State` ([Chapter 2](02_game_grid_state.md)), which is the current snapshot of our puzzle board, and the individual `Puzzle Slot`s ([Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md)), the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to meet the \"brain\" of our puzzle system: the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### What Problem Does the Puzzle Engine Solve?\n\nImagine you have a board game. You have the board pieces (`Puzzle Slot`s), you know where they are right now (`Game Grid State`), and you have the rulebook (`Puzzle Configuration`). But who actually *plays* the game? Who makes sure moves are valid? Who updates the board when a piece moves? Who tells you when you've won?\n\nThat's exactly what the `Puzzle Engine` does! It's the active component that takes the rules and the current state and *makes the game happen*. It's like the game master or the referee that understands all the rules and manages the flow of play.\n\n**Use Case**: A player clicks on a `Puzzle Slot` to try and make a move. How does the game know if that move is allowed? How does it update the board if it is? The `Puzzle Engine` is responsible for answering these questions and performing the necessary actions.\n\n### The Brain of the Operation\n\nThe `Puzzle Engine` is the central orchestrator for gameplay. Its main jobs include:\n\n1.  **Validating Moves**: When a player tries to do something (like swap two pieces), the `Puzzle Engine` checks the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if that action is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`.\n2.  **Applying Moves**: If a move is valid, the `Puzzle Engine` updates the `Game Grid State` to reflect the change. This might involve changing what's inside one or more `Puzzle Slot`s.\n3.  **Checking Win Conditions**: After each move, or at specific times, the `Puzzle Engine` consults the `Puzzle Configuration` to determine if the player has met the conditions to win the puzzle.\n4.  **Managing Game Flow**: It ensures the game progresses according to its rules.\n\nThink of it this way:\n*   The `Puzzle Configuration` is the *recipe*.\n*   The `Game Grid State` is the *ingredients and what's currently cooking*.\n*   The `Puzzle Engine` is the *chef* who follows the recipe to cook the meal and decides when it's done!\n\n### How the Puzzle Engine Works (High-Level)\n\nLet's trace our use case: a player wants to make a move.\n\n1.  The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a `Puzzle Slot`). This interaction is captured by the `Input Controller` (which we'll cover in [Chapter 5: Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n2.  The `Input Controller` tells the `Puzzle Engine` what the player tried to do.\n3.  The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this player action, looks at the current `Game Grid State`, and consults the `Puzzle Configuration` (the rules).\n4.  Based on the rules, it decides if the move is valid.\n5.  If valid, it updates the `Game Grid State` (changing the contents of `Puzzle Slot`s).\n6.  Finally, it checks if the puzzle is now solved.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n\n    Player->>IC: Tries to make a move (e.g., click)\n    IC->>PE: Request to make move(slotId, action)\n    PE->>GGS: Get current state of slot(s)\n    PE->>PC: Check rules for move validity\n    alt Move is Valid\n        PE->>GGS: Update state (change Puzzle Slot content)\n        PE->>PC: Check for win condition\n        alt Puzzle is Solved\n            PE-->>Player: Puzzle Solved!\n        else\n            PE-->>Player: Move successful!\n        end\n    else Move is Invalid\n        PE-->>Player: Invalid move!\n    end\n```\n\n### Inside the Puzzle Engine\n\nLet's look at a very simplified idea of what the `Puzzle Engine` might look like in code. Remember, we're keeping it super simple to understand the core idea!\n\nImagine a basic `PuzzleEngine` class that needs to know about the `Game Grid State` and the `Puzzle Configuration` to do its job.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified example)\n\nimport { GameGridState } from './game_grid_state'; // From Chapter 2\nimport { PuzzleConfiguration } from './puzzle_configuration'; // From Chapter 3\n\nclass PuzzleEngine {\n  private gridState: GameGridState;\n  private config: PuzzleConfiguration;\n\n  constructor(initialConfig: PuzzleConfiguration) {\n    this.config = initialConfig;\n    // The engine creates the initial game state based on the configuration\n    this.gridState = new GameGridState(initialConfig.initialLayout);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like checkWinCondition, etc.\n}\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n*   The `PuzzleEngine` takes a `PuzzleConfiguration` when it's created. This gives it all the rules and the starting layout.\n*   It then uses this configuration to create an initial `GameGridState`. This means our engine is ready to manage a specific puzzle!\n\nNow, let's see how it might handle a player's move. Let's say our puzzle involves \"flipping\" a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified makeMove method)\n\n// ... (inside the PuzzleEngine class)\n\n  makeMove(slotId: string): boolean {\n    // 1. Check if the move is valid according to the configuration rules\n    if (!this.config.isValidFlip(slotId, this.gridState)) {\n      console.log(`Move on slot ${slotId} is not allowed!`);\n      return false; // Move is invalid\n    }\n\n    // 2. If valid, apply the move to the Game Grid State\n    this.gridState.flipSlot(slotId); // This changes the Puzzle Slot's content\n    console.log(`Slot ${slotId} was flipped.`);\n\n    // 3. After the move, check if the puzzle is now solved\n    if (this.checkWinCondition()) {\n      console.log(\"Congratulations! Puzzle Solved!\");\n    }\n    return true; // Move was successful\n  }\n\n  checkWinCondition(): boolean {\n    // This method would compare the current gridState with the\n    // win condition defined in the PuzzleConfiguration.\n    // For simplicity, let's imagine a simple check:\n    return this.config.isSolved(this.gridState);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this `makeMove` method:\n*   It first asks the `Puzzle Configuration` (`this.config.isValidFlip`) if the proposed move (flipping `slotId`) is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`. This is where the rules come into play!\n*   If the move is valid, it tells the `Game Grid State` (`this.gridState.flipSlot`) to update itself. This means the `Game Grid State` will modify the specific `Puzzle Slot` at `slotId`.\n*   Finally, it calls `checkWinCondition()`, which again uses the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if the current `Game Grid State` matches the winning pattern.\n\nThis shows how the `Puzzle Engine` acts as the central coordinator, using information from the `Puzzle Configuration` and manipulating the `Game Grid State` (which contains our `Puzzle Slot`s) to manage the game.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the role of the `Puzzle Engine`. It's the active \"brain\" of our puzzle system, responsible for interpreting the rules from the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md), managing the current game board through the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), and ensuring the game progresses correctly. It validates player actions, applies changes to the board, and determines when the puzzle is solved.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Puzzle Engine` processes moves, the next logical step is to see how players actually *tell* the engine what they want to do. In our next chapter, we'll explore the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md), which is the bridge between the player and the `Puzzle Engine`.",
          "# Chapter 5: Input Controller\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](04_puzzle_engine.md), we explored the `Puzzle Engine`, which is the \"brain\" of our game, responsible for applying rules and updating the puzzle based on its [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and the current [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). We've learned about the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, the grid, the rules, and the engine that makes it all work.\n\nBut how does a player actually *interact* with this amazing system? How does the game know when you want to move a piece, click a button, or solve a puzzle? That's where the `Input Controller` comes in!\n\n### What Problem Does the Input Controller Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a puzzle game on your computer or phone. You click on a square, or maybe drag a piece from one spot to another. These actions are how you tell the game what you want to do. The game needs a way to \"hear\" these actions, understand them, and then tell the `Puzzle Engine` to react.\n\nThe `Input Controller` is like the game's ears and hands. Its job is to:\n1.  **Listen** for player actions (like mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or touch gestures).\n2.  **Translate** those actions into meaningful game commands (e.g., \"player clicked on slot at row 2, column 3\").\n3.  **Communicate** these commands to the `Puzzle Engine` so the game can respond.\n\nWithout an `Input Controller`, our game would just sit there, beautiful but unresponsive. It's the crucial link that makes the game interactive!\n\n### The Input Controller in Action: A Simple Click\n\nLet's consider a common use case: a player clicks on a specific `Puzzle Slot` on the game board.\n\n**How it works at a high level:**\n\n1.  The player sees the game board on their screen.\n2.  They move their mouse and click on one of the visual representations of a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n3.  The `Input Controller` detects this click.\n4.  It figures out *which* [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked based on where the mouse was.\n5.  It then tells the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), \"Hey, the slot at (this row, this column) was just clicked!\"\n6.  The [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) then decides what to do next (e.g., change the slot's content, check for a match, etc.).\n\n### Analogy: The Game's Receptionist\n\nThink of the `Input Controller` as a very efficient receptionist for our puzzle game.\n\n*   **You (the Player)** walk into the game's \"office\" and say, \"I want to interact with this specific part of the puzzle!\" (This is your mouse click or keyboard press).\n*   **The Receptionist (Input Controller)** hears you, understands *what* you're pointing at, and figures out *which* part of the puzzle you mean.\n*   The receptionist then goes to **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** and says, \"The player wants to do something with the puzzle piece in slot A3.\"\n*   **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** then decides if that action is allowed according to the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and updates the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) accordingly.\n\n### Inside the Input Controller: How it Listens and Commands\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how an `Input Controller` might be set up to listen for clicks.\n\n```typescript\n// src/input_controller.ts (Simplified example)\n\n// We need to tell the Input Controller about our Puzzle Engine\nimport { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md'; \n\nclass InputController {\n    private puzzleEngine: PuzzleEngine; // Our game's brain\n\n    constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine) {\n        this.puzzleEngine = engine;\n        // This line tells the browser to listen for clicks on our 'game-board' element.\n        // When a click happens, it calls our 'handleClick' method.\n        document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));\n        console.log(\"Input Controller is now listening for clicks!\");\n    }\n\n    private handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {\n        // In a real game, we'd calculate which specific Puzzle Slot was clicked\n        // based on 'event.clientX' and 'event.clientY' and the grid layout.\n        // For this example, let's pretend we figured out it was slot (0,0).\n        const clickedRow = 0;\n        const clickedCol = 0;\n\n        console.log(`Player clicked on slot (${clickedRow}, ${clickedCol})`);\n        \n        // Now, we tell the Puzzle Engine what happened!\n        this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example of how you might create and use it in your main application file (src/main.ts)\n// import { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md';\n// import { InputController } from './input_controller.ts'; // Assuming this file exists\n\n// const myPuzzleEngine = new PuzzleEngine(somePuzzleConfiguration); // Imagine this is set up\n// const myInputController = new InputController(myPuzzleEngine);\n// myInputController.startListening(); // A method to start the listeners if not in constructor\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine)`**: When we create an `InputController`, we give it a reference to our `PuzzleEngine`. This is crucial because the `Input Controller` needs to *tell* the engine about player actions.\n2.  **`document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener(...)`**: This is how web applications listen for user interactions. We're saying, \"Hey browser, whenever someone clicks on the HTML element with the ID 'game-board', please run our `handleClick` function.\"\n3.  **`handleClick(event: MouseEvent)`**: This function is called every time a click occurs on the game board.\n    *   `event: MouseEvent` contains details about the click, like where on the screen it happened.\n    *   `const clickedRow = 0; const clickedCol = 0;` (Simplified): In a real game, we'd use the `event` data and knowledge of our [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)'s layout to precisely determine which [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked. For this example, we're just hardcoding it to `(0,0)` to keep it simple.\n    *   **`this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);`**: This is the most important part! The `Input Controller` doesn't *do* the game logic itself. It simply translates the player's action into a command and passes it to the `Puzzle Engine`, which is responsible for processing game rules and updating the game state.\n\n### The Flow of an Input\n\nLet's visualize the journey of a player's click through our system:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as Game UI (HTML)\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on a puzzle slot (e.g., a square on screen)\n    UI->>IC: Notifies of click event (e.g., \"click at x=100, y=50\")\n    IC->>IC: Determines which Puzzle Slot was clicked (e.g., \"slot at row 1, col 2\")\n    IC->>PE: Sends \"SlotClicked\" command (e.g., \"slot(1, 2) clicked\")\n    PE->>GGS: Updates Game Grid State based on game rules\n    GGS-->>PE: State updated (e.g., \"slot(1,2) now contains 'X'\")\n    PE-->>IC: (Optional) Acknowledges or provides feedback\n    IC-->>UI: (Optional) Triggers UI update to show new game state\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `Input Controller` acts as the crucial intermediary. It takes raw user input, makes sense of it in the context of our game, and then hands off a clear instruction to the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Input Controller` is a vital component that bridges the gap between the player and the game's internal logic. It listens for player actions, translates them into game-specific commands, and then passes these commands to the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) for processing. Without it, our beautifully configured puzzles and powerful engine would remain untouched and unplayable. It's what makes our game interactive and fun!\n\nNext, we'll shift gears from playing the game to *creating* the game. We'll explore the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), which is a visual tool designed to help puzzle creators build and configure new puzzles using all the concepts we've learned so far.",
          "# Chapter 6: Puzzle Editor UI\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](05_input_controller.md), we explored the `Input Controller`, which is all about how players interact with an *already existing* puzzle game – clicking, dragging, and making moves. It's the bridge between a player's actions and the game's logic.\n\nBut what if you want to create a *brand new* puzzle? How do you design the starting layout, decide which slots are empty, or place specific items? That's where the `Puzzle Editor UI` comes in!\n\n### The Puzzle Designer's Workbench\n\nImagine you're not just a player, but a puzzle designer. You have an idea for a challenging new puzzle. You need a tool, a \"workbench,\" where you can visually lay out your puzzle, slot by slot, until it looks just right. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is exactly that workbench.\n\nIts main job is to provide a friendly visual interface that allows you to easily create and modify a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md). Remember, the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) is the blueprint for a puzzle – it defines its initial state and rules. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is the tool you use to *draw* that blueprint.\n\n**Use Case**: Let's say you want to design a simple 2x2 puzzle. You want the top-left slot to contain a 'star', the top-right to be 'empty', the bottom-left to contain a 'circle', and the bottom-right to be 'empty'. The `Puzzle Editor UI` lets you click on a visual grid and assign these values, then save your creation.\n\n### What is a UI? (User Interface)\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's quickly clarify \"UI.\" UI stands for **User Interface**. It's simply anything you see and interact with on a screen – buttons, menus, text fields, and in our case, a visual representation of a puzzle grid. It's how a human tells a computer what to do, and how the computer shows information back to the human.\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is the visual part of our system that lets you \"talk\" to the puzzle creation process.\n\n### How the Puzzle Editor UI Works\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` essentially does two main things:\n\n1.  **Visualizes a Puzzle**: It displays a grid, much like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), but for editing purposes. Each square in this grid represents a potential [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n2.  **Allows Interaction**: You can click on these squares (slots) to change what they contain (e.g., from empty to a star, or a circle). It also provides buttons to save your work.\n\nWhen you save your puzzle in the editor, it takes all your visual choices and packages them up into a structured data format – specifically, a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object. This object can then be used by the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to run the game, or by the [HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md) to create a playable version.\n\n#### Step-by-Step: Designing a Puzzle\n\nLet's walk through how you'd use the `Puzzle Editor UI` to create our 2x2 puzzle:\n\n1.  **Open the Editor**: You'd launch the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It might show you an empty grid or load a previously saved puzzle.\n2.  **See the Grid**: The UI displays a grid of editable [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n    *(Imagine this is a visual grid in your browser)*\n3.  **Click to Edit**: You click on the top-left slot. A small menu might pop up, or the slot might cycle through different types (empty, star, circle). You select 'star'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n4.  **Continue Editing**: You click the bottom-left slot and select 'circle'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    | ● |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n5.  **Save Your Work**: Once you're happy with your design, you click a \"Save Puzzle\" button.\n\nWhat happens behind the scenes when you click \"Save\"? The `Puzzle Editor UI` gathers all the information about your visually designed grid and converts it into a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) data structure.\n\nHere's a simplified example of what that saved configuration might look like (as we discussed in [Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)):\n\n```javascript\n// This is the Puzzle Configuration generated by the UI\nconst myNewPuzzleConfig = {\n  id: \"my-first-2x2-puzzle\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  // ... other rules and settings (simplified for example)\n};\n```\n**Output**: The `Puzzle Editor UI` doesn't output a visual, but rather a data structure (like the `myNewPuzzleConfig` above) that describes your puzzle. This data can then be stored and used later.\n\n### Under the Hood: How the Editor Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `Puzzle Editor UI` manages to turn your clicks into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\n#### The Editor's Internal Process\n\nWhen you interact with the `Puzzle Editor UI`, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant EditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant InternalGridData as Editor's Internal Grid Data\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration (File/Object)\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 1. Opens Editor\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 2. Initializes/Loads blank grid\n    EditorUI-->>User: 3. Displays empty grid\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 4. Clicks on a slot (e.g., top-left)\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 5. Updates internal data for that slot (e.g., \"star\")\n    EditorUI-->>User: 6. Updates visual display of the slot\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 7. Clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\n    EditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: 8. Converts InternalGridData to Puzzle Configuration format\n    PuzzleConfig-->>EditorUI: 9. Returns generated config data\n    EditorUI-->>User: 10. Confirms puzzle saved\n```\n\n1.  **Initialization**: When you open the editor, it creates an internal representation of the puzzle grid. This is like a temporary scratchpad where it keeps track of what you're designing.\n2.  **User Interaction**: When you click a slot, the `Puzzle Editor UI` updates this internal scratchpad. It doesn't immediately create a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) file; it just notes down your changes.\n3.  **Saving**: Only when you click \"Save\" does the `Puzzle Editor UI` take everything on its scratchpad and carefully package it into the official [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) format. This format is what the rest of our system understands.\n\n#### Simplified Code Example (Internal Logic)\n\nLet's imagine a very basic way the `Puzzle Editor UI` might manage its internal grid data and then generate a configuration.\n\nFirst, the editor needs a way to store the current state of the puzzle being designed. This could be a simple array of arrays, similar to how `initialState` is represented in a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md):\n\n```javascript\n// Inside the Puzzle Editor UI's logic\nlet currentEditorGrid = [\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"],\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"]\n];\n\n// This represents the 2x2 grid the user sees and interacts with.\n```\nWhen a user clicks on a slot, the editor updates this `currentEditorGrid`. For instance, if the user clicks the top-left slot (row 0, column 0) and sets it to 'star':\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when a user clicks a slot in the UI\nfunction updateSlotInEditor(row, col, value) {\n  currentEditorGrid[row][col] = value;\n  console.log(`Slot (${row}, ${col}) updated to: ${value}`);\n  // The UI would then visually update the displayed slot\n}\n\n// Example: User sets top-left to 'star'\nupdateSlotInEditor(0, 0, \"star\");\n// Example: User sets bottom-left to 'circle'\nupdateSlotInEditor(1, 0, \"circle\");\n\n// currentEditorGrid is now:\n// [\n//   [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n//   [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n// ]\n```\n**Output**: The `console.log` shows the internal update. Visually, the editor would change the appearance of the clicked slot.\n\nFinally, when the user clicks \"Save,\" the `Puzzle Editor UI` takes this `currentEditorGrid` and wraps it into a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object:\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when the user clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\nfunction generatePuzzleConfiguration() {\n  const rows = currentEditorGrid.length;\n  const cols = currentEditorGrid[0].length;\n\n  const newConfig = {\n    id: \"user-designed-puzzle-\" + Date.now(), // Unique ID\n    gridSize: { rows: rows, cols: cols },\n    initialState: currentEditorGrid,\n    // Add other default rules or settings here\n    rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n  };\n\n  console.log(\"Generated Puzzle Configuration:\", newConfig);\n  // This 'newConfig' would then be saved to a file or database.\n  return newConfig;\n}\n\nconst savedConfig = generatePuzzleConfiguration();\n```\n**Output**:\n```\nGenerated Puzzle Configuration: {\n  id: \"user-designed-puzzle-...\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n}\n```\nThis `newConfig` is the valuable output of the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It's a complete blueprint ready for the game!\n\nWhile the `src/config.ts` file (which might contain general settings like `port` or `database`) isn't directly involved in the *logic* of generating a puzzle configuration, a real-world `Puzzle Editor UI` might use such a configuration file to know *where* to save the generated puzzle configurations (e.g., to a specific database or API endpoint).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is your creative hub for designing new puzzles. It provides a visual interface to interact with and modify the layout of a puzzle grid. By clicking and selecting items for individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, you build up your desired puzzle. When you save, the editor translates your visual design into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object, which is the blueprint for any new puzzle. It's the essential tool for anyone who wants to move beyond playing and start creating!\n\nNow that we know how to *create* a puzzle's blueprint using the `Puzzle Editor UI`, the next logical step is to turn that blueprint into a playable game that someone can actually see and interact with in a web browser. In our next chapter, we'll explore the `HTML Game Generator`, which takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and builds the actual web page for the game.\n\n[Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md)",
          "# Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), we explored the `Puzzle Editor UI`. That's where you, the game designer, get to be creative – dragging, dropping, and arranging elements to craft amazing new puzzles. You learned how to define the starting layout and rules, essentially creating a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\nBut once you've designed a masterpiece in the editor, what's next? How do you let someone *play* your game without them needing to open the editor themselves? How do you share your creation with friends, or even upload it to a website?\n\nThis is exactly the problem the `HTML Game Generator` solves! It's like taking your carefully prepared puzzle recipe (the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) and baking it into a delicious, ready-to-eat cake (a standalone HTML game file) that anyone can enjoy with just a web browser.\n\n### What is the HTML Game Generator?\n\nAt its core, the `HTML Game Generator` is a special tool that takes all the information about your puzzle – its size, initial items, and rules (your [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) – and packages it into a single, self-contained `.html` file. This file contains everything needed to play the game:\n\n*   The puzzle's data.\n*   The game's logic (like the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) and [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n*   The visual presentation (HTML and CSS).\n\nThink of it as a \"game exporter.\" You design the puzzle, and the generator creates the playable version.\n\n### Why Do We Need It?\n\nImagine you've spent hours crafting a challenging new puzzle. You want to share it!\n\n*   **For Players**: Players don't need to see the complex editor. They just want to click a file and start playing. The `HTML Game Generator` provides this simple, direct experience.\n*   **For Sharing**: You can send a single `.html` file to a friend, and they can open it in Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser. No installation, no special software needed!\n*   **For Deployment**: If you want to put your game on a website, you can simply upload the generated HTML file.\n\nWithout the `HTML Game Generator`, your amazing puzzles would be stuck inside the editor, unable to be easily shared or played by others.\n\n### How It Works: The Big Picture\n\nThe process is quite straightforward:\n\n1.  You provide the `HTML Game Generator` with a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n2.  It takes a basic HTML template (like a blank canvas for a web page).\n3.  It then \"fills in\" this template by embedding your puzzle's data directly into the HTML.\n4.  It also adds all the necessary JavaScript code for the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) (to run the game logic) and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (to handle player clicks/drags).\n5.  Finally, it gives you back a single string of text, which is the complete HTML content for your game. You can then save this string to a `.html` file.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Puzzle Configuration] --> B{HTML Game Generator};\n    C[HTML Template] --> B;\n    D[Game Logic (JS/CSS)] --> B;\n    B --> E[Generated HTML File];\n```\n\n### Using the HTML Game Generator\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how you might use this generator. Imagine you have a `puzzleConfig` object, which is the result of your work in the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) and contains all the details of your puzzle.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is our Puzzle Configuration data,\n// created by the Puzzle Editor UI (Chapter 6)\nconst myPuzzleConfig = {\n  gridSize: { rows: 3, cols: 3 },\n  initialState: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    { x: 1, y: 0, type: 'block' },\n    { x: 2, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    // ... more puzzle slot data ...\n  ],\n  rules: [\n    { type: 'move', condition: 'adjacent', action: 'swap' }\n    // ... more rules ...\n  ]\n};\n\n// This function would be part of our HTML Game Generator\nfunction generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n  // Internally, this function builds a big HTML string.\n  // For this example, we'll just show a simplified output.\n  return `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n    const initialConfig = ${JSON.stringify(config)};\n    // ... game engine and input controller code would go here ...\n  </script></body></html>`;\n}\n\n// Now, let's generate the HTML for our puzzle!\nconst gameHtmlContent = generateGameHtml(myPuzzleConfig);\n\nconsole.log(\"Generated HTML starts with:\", gameHtmlContent.substring(0, 100));\n// Output: Generated HTML starts with: <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n//         const initialConfig = {\n```\n\nIn this example, `generateGameHtml` takes your `myPuzzleConfig` and returns a long string that represents a complete HTML file. You would then save this string to a file named `my_awesome_puzzle.html`, and anyone could open it in their browser to play!\n\n### Under the Hood: How It Generates the HTML\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `HTML Game Generator` actually constructs that HTML file. It's like a chef assembling a meal: they start with a plate (the HTML template), add the main dish (your puzzle data), and then add the sauces and garnishes (the game logic scripts).\n\nHere's a step-by-step flow of what happens:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Caller as Puzzle Editor UI (or similar)\n    participant HGG as HTML Game Generator\n    participant Template as HTML Template File\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant GameScripts as Game Logic Scripts\n    participant Output as Generated HTML String\n\n    Caller->>HGG: Request game HTML (puzzleConfig)\n    HGG->>Template: Read base HTML structure\n    HGG->>PC: Get serialized puzzle data (JSON)\n    HGG->>GameScripts: Read Puzzle Engine & Input Controller code\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed puzzle data into template\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed game scripts into template\n    HGG->>Output: Return complete HTML string\n    Output-->>Caller: HTML content ready\n```\n\nLet's look at a simplified conceptual code snippet that shows how this might work:\n\n```typescript\n// src/htmlGameGenerator.ts (Conceptual)\n\n// Imagine this is a basic HTML structure with placeholders\n// for where our puzzle data and game scripts will go.\nconst baseHtmlTemplate = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Generated Puzzle Game</title>\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: sans-serif; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; margin: 0; background-color: #f0f0f0; }\n        #game-container { border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; background-color: white; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game-container\">\n        <!-- The game will render here -->\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        // This is where our puzzle configuration will be injected!\n        const initialPuzzleConfig = {{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}};\n    </script>\n    <script>{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n`;\n\n// In a real system, these functions would read actual JavaScript files\n// containing the code for the Puzzle Engine and Input Controller.\nfunction getGameEngineScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n    return `\n        // Simplified Puzzle Engine code\n        class PuzzleEngine {\n            constructor(config) { console.log(\"Engine initialized with config:\", config); }\n            applyMove(state, move) { console.log(\"Applying move:\", move); return state; }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\nfunction getInputControllerScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 5: Input Controller\n    return `\n        // Simplified Input Controller code\n        class InputController {\n            constructor(gameElement, engine) {\n                console.log(\"Input Controller ready for:\", gameElement);\n                gameElement.addEventListener('click', () => engine.applyMove({}, 'click'));\n            }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\n// This is the main function of our HTML Game Generator\nexport function generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n    // 1. Convert the puzzle configuration object into a JSON string.\n    //    This makes it easy to embed directly into JavaScript.\n    const configJson = JSON.stringify(config, null, 2); // 'null, 2' makes it nicely formatted\n\n    // 2. Gather all the necessary game logic scripts.\n    //    This includes the Puzzle Engine, Input Controller, and any\n    //    code to actually start the game.\n    const allGameScripts = `\n        ${getGameEngineScript()}\n        ${getInputControllerScript()}\n\n        // Code to initialize and start the game when the page loads\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n            const gameContainer = document.getElementById('game-container');\n            const engine = new PuzzleEngine(initialPuzzleConfig);\n            new InputController(gameContainer, engine);\n            console.log(\"Game started!\");\n            // In a real game, the engine would render the initial state here\n        });\n    `;\n\n    // 3. Replace the placeholders in our base HTML template\n    //    with the actual puzzle data and game scripts.\n    let finalHtml = baseHtmlTemplate\n        .replace('{{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}}', configJson)\n        .replace('{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}', allGameScripts);\n\n    return finalHtml;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `generateGameHtml` function acts as an assembler. It takes your puzzle's blueprint (`config`), fetches the standard parts (template, engine code, input code), and then carefully puts them all together into a single, functional HTML file.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `HTML Game Generator`, a vital component that bridges the gap between designing a puzzle and playing it. We learned that:\n\n*   It takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) (the rules and initial state of your puzzle).\n*   It combines this data with a basic HTML structure, the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) logic, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) code.\n*   The result is a single, standalone `.html` file that can be opened in any web browser, making your puzzle playable and easily shareable.\n\nThis concludes our journey through the core components of our puzzle game system! We've covered everything from the smallest building block, the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md), to how the entire game is packaged for players. You now have a solid understanding of how these pieces work together to create a complete and interactive puzzle experience."

We're going to start with a fundamental building block: the `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n### Project Summary\n\nBefore we dive in, here's a quick overview of the main components we'll be exploring throughout this tutorial:\n\n*   **Puzzle Configuration**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Configuration and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Engine**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Engine and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Slot**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Slot and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Game Grid State**: A comprehensive overview of Game Grid State and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Puzzle Editor UI**: A comprehensive overview of Puzzle Editor UI and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **HTML Game Generator**: A comprehensive overview of HTML Game Generator and its role in the system architecture.\n*   **Input Controller**: A comprehensive overview of Input Controller and its role in the system architecture.\n\n---\n\n# Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot\n\n### What Problem Does \"Puzzle Slot\" Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a game like Sudoku, a sliding block puzzle, or even a simple tic-tac-toe. All these games happen on a grid, right? Each square on that grid can either be empty, or it can hold a specific piece (like a number in Sudoku, a block in a sliding puzzle, or an 'X'/'O' in tic-tac-toe).\n\nHow do we represent these individual squares in our code? How do we keep track of what's in each one, and where it is on the board? This is exactly the problem the `Puzzle Slot` abstraction solves!\n\nThink of a `Puzzle Slot` as a single, individual square on your game board. It's like one cell in a spreadsheet, but for your game. Each `Puzzle Slot` knows its exact position and what's currently inside it.\n\n#### Use Case: Building a Simple Block Puzzle\n\nLet's say we're building a simple puzzle game where players move colored blocks around a grid. Our game board is a 3x3 grid.\n\n```\n+---+---+---+\n| R | B |   |\n+---+---+---+\n|   | G | R |\n+---+---+---+\n| B |   | G |\n+---+---+---+\n```\n\nIn this example:\n*   The top-left square contains a Red block.\n*   The top-right square is empty.\n*   The middle-center square contains a Green block.\n\nEach of these nine squares would be represented by a `Puzzle Slot`. A `Puzzle Slot` helps us answer questions like:\n1.  What's at position `(0, 0)` (top-left)? (Answer: A Red block)\n2.  Is position `(0, 2)` (top-right) empty? (Answer: Yes)\n3.  What color block is at position `(1, 1)` (middle-center)? (Answer: Green)\n\n### The Core Idea: What is a Puzzle Slot?\n\nAt its heart, a `Puzzle Slot` is a simple data container. It holds information about a single position on your game grid.\n\nHere are the key pieces of information a `Puzzle Slot` typically stores:\n\n1.  **Location**: Where is this slot on the grid? This is usually represented by `x` and `y` coordinates (or `row` and `column`).\n2.  **Content**: What is currently occupying this slot? Is it empty? Does it hold a specific puzzle piece, a number, a color, or some other game element?\n3.  **Properties (Optional)**: Does this slot have any special rules or characteristics? For example, is it a \"fixed\" slot that the player can't change? Is it a \"goal\" slot that a specific piece needs to reach?\n\nLet's visualize this with a simple diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleSlot {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string content\n        +boolean isFixed\n    }\n```\n*This diagram shows that a `Puzzle Slot` is like a blueprint for an object that has an `x` coordinate, a `y` coordinate, some `content` (like \"Red Block\" or \"empty\"), and a flag `isFixed` to say if it can be changed.*\n\n### How We Use Puzzle Slots\n\nIn our system, `Puzzle Slot` objects are created to represent every single position on the game board. They are then organized and managed by other parts of the system, like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which keeps track of all the slots together to form the complete board.\n\nLet's look at a very simplified example of how you might define a `Puzzle Slot` in code. Remember, we're keeping it super minimal to focus on the core idea!\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleSlot.ts (Conceptual file)\n\ninterface PuzzleSlot {\n  x: number; // The column on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  y: number; // The row on the grid (e.g., 0, 1, 2)\n  content: string | null; // What's in this slot? 'Red Block', 'Blue Block', or null if empty\n  isFixed: boolean; // Can the player change this slot?\n}\n\n// Example of creating a Puzzle Slot\nconst topLeftSlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  content: \"Red Block\",\n  isFixed: false, // Player can move this block\n};\n\nconst emptySlot: PuzzleSlot = {\n  x: 0,\n  y: 2,\n  content: null, // This slot is empty\n  isFixed: false,\n};\n\nconsole.log(topLeftSlot);\n// Output: { x: 0, y: 0, content: 'Red Block', isFixed: false }\n```\n*In this example, we define what a `PuzzleSlot` looks like using an `interface`. Then, we create two example `PuzzleSlot` objects. One holds a \"Red Block\" at `(0,0)`, and another is `empty` at `(0,2)`. Notice how `content` can be `null` to indicate emptiness.*\n\nThis simple structure allows us to describe any square on our puzzle board.\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Slots Work\n\nA `Puzzle Slot` itself doesn't perform complex actions. It's primarily a data structure. Its main job is to *hold* information. Other parts of our system then *read* from and *write* to these `Puzzle Slot` objects.\n\nFor instance, when the game needs to know what's at a specific position, it will ask the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) for the `Puzzle Slot` at those coordinates, and then read its `content`. When a player makes a move, the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) might tell the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to update the `content` of a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\nLet's imagine a very simple flow for how a `Puzzle Slot`'s content might be accessed:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant InputController\n    participant GameGridState\n    participant PuzzleSlot\n\n    Player->>InputController: Tries to move block to (1,1)\n    InputController->>GameGridState: Get slot at (1,1)\n    GameGridState->>PuzzleSlot: What is your content?\n    PuzzleSlot-->>GameGridState: \"Green Block\"\n    GameGridState-->>InputController: Slot (1,1) has \"Green Block\"\n    InputController->>Player: (Decides if move is valid based on content)\n```\n*This sequence diagram shows how a player's action (trying to move a block) eventually leads to the `GameGridState` asking a specific `PuzzleSlot` for its `content`. The `PuzzleSlot` simply provides the data it holds.*\n\nThe `Puzzle Slot` is a foundational piece of data that many other parts of our system rely on. It's like a single brick in a wall – it doesn't build the house, but it's essential for the wall to exist.\n\nWhile the `src/utils.ts` file you saw in the project context contains general utility functions like `formatDate`, it doesn't directly define or manipulate `Puzzle Slot` objects. `Puzzle Slot` definitions would typically reside in a file dedicated to game data structures, like `src/puzzleSlot.ts` (as shown in our conceptual example).\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that a `Puzzle Slot` is a fundamental building block for our puzzle game. It represents a single position on the game board, storing its location, what's inside it, and any special properties it might have. It's a simple data container that helps us describe the state of our game grid.\n\nUnderstanding `Puzzle Slot` is crucial because it's the smallest unit of our game board. In the next chapter, we'll see how these individual `Puzzle Slot`s are brought together to form the complete game board. We'll explore the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), which is responsible for managing all the `Puzzle Slot`s and providing a complete picture of the puzzle board at any given moment.\n\nReady to see how all these individual squares form a complete puzzle? Let's move on!\n\n[Next Chapter: Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)",
          "# Chapter 2: Game Grid State\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](01_puzzle_slot.md), we explored the `Puzzle Slot`, which is like a single, individual container on our puzzle board. It knows what's inside itself, but it doesn't know anything about its neighbors or the puzzle as a whole.\n\nToday, we're going to zoom out and look at the bigger picture: the `Game Grid State`. If a `Puzzle Slot` is one brick, the `Game Grid State` is the blueprint and current status of the entire wall built from those bricks!\n\n### What Problem Does Game Grid State Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a Sudoku game. You've placed a '5' in one square, a '2' in another, and so on. How does the game know:\n1.  What number is in *every* square?\n2.  If you've made a mistake (e.g., two '5's in the same row)?\n3.  If you've finally completed the puzzle?\n\nThe answer to all these questions lies with the `Game Grid State`. It's the central brain that keeps track of the *entire* puzzle board at any given moment. It holds all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and knows what's inside each one.\n\nOur central use case for this chapter is: **How does the game keep track of all the pieces on the board and update them when a player makes a move?** The `Game Grid State` is designed precisely for this!\n\n### What is Game Grid State?\n\nThink of the `Game Grid State` as a digital map or a spreadsheet of your entire puzzle board. Each cell in this spreadsheet corresponds to a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n\nIt's a single object that contains and manages all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s that make up your puzzle. When you look at the `Game Grid State`, you should be able to tell exactly what's happening on every part of your board.\n\nHere's a simple way to visualize it:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Game Grid State] --> B[Puzzle Slot (0,0)]\n    A --> C[Puzzle Slot (0,1)]\n    A --> D[Puzzle Slot (1,0)]\n    A --> E[Puzzle Slot (1,1)]\n    A --- F[...]\n    F --> G[Puzzle Slot (N,M)]\n\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\nIn this diagram, `Game Grid State` is the overarching container, and it holds many individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, each identified by its position (like `(0,0)` for top-left, `(0,1)` for top-middle, etc.).\n\n### How to Use Game Grid State: Updating the Board\n\nLet's go back to our use case: a player makes a move. For example, they place a 'circle' piece into the top-left slot of a 2x2 grid. How does the `Game Grid State` handle this?\n\nThe `Game Grid State` provides methods to interact with the slots it manages. You tell it *which* slot to update (using its row and column) and *what* new content to put there.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might create a `GameGridState` and update one of its slots:\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is part of your game logic\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We're using the PuzzleSlot from Chapter 1!\n\nclass GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // A 2D array to hold all our Puzzle Slots\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = [];\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = [];\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new, empty PuzzleSlot\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us update the content of a specific slot\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        // We'll look at the internal details of this method next!\n        console.log(`Request to update slot at (${row},${col}) with: ${newContent}`);\n        // ... internal logic to find and update the slot ...\n    }\n\n    // This method lets us see what's inside a specific slot\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        // ... internal logic to find and return slot content ...\n        return \"Current Content\"; // Placeholder\n    }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\nconst myGameGrid = new GameGridState(2, 2); // Create a 2x2 puzzle grid\n\nconsole.log(\"Initial content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: Initial content of (0,0): Current Content (or whatever PuzzleSlot defaults to)\n\nmyGameGrid.updateSlotContent(0, 0, \"Circle\"); // Player places a 'Circle' in the top-left slot\n// Output: Request to update slot at (0,0) with: Circle\n\nconsole.log(\"New content of (0,0):\", myGameGrid.getSlotContent(0, 0));\n// Output: New content of (0,0): Circle (after the update)\n```\n**Explanation:**\n1.  We create an instance of `GameGridState`, specifying its size (e.g., 2 rows, 2 columns).\n2.  When `updateSlotContent` is called, we tell the `GameGridState` exactly *where* (row 0, column 0) and *what* (\"Circle\") to place.\n3.  The `GameGridState` then takes care of finding the correct [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) and updating its content.\n\n### Internal Implementation: What's Under the Hood?\n\nHow does `GameGridState` actually manage all those [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s and update them? Let's peek behind the curtain.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Process\n\nWhen a player makes a move, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PS as Puzzle Slot\n\n    Player->>IC: Clicks on slot (0,0) to place 'X'\n    IC->>GGS: Request: updateSlotContent(0,0, \"X\")\n    GGS->>GGS: Finds the Puzzle Slot at (0,0)\n    GGS->>PS: Calls PS.setContent(\"X\")\n    PS-->>GGS: Slot content updated\n    GGS-->>IC: Update successful\n    IC-->>Player: Shows 'X' on the screen\n```\n\n1.  **Player Interaction**: The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a square on the screen).\n2.  **Input Controller**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (which we'll cover in a later chapter) detects this interaction and translates it into a meaningful action, like \"update slot (0,0) with 'X'\".\n3.  **Game Grid State Request**: The [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) then tells the `Game Grid State` to perform this update.\n4.  **Finding the Slot**: The `Game Grid State` looks through its internal collection of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s to find the one at the specified coordinates (0,0).\n5.  **Updating the Slot**: Once found, the `Game Grid State` doesn't change the content itself. Instead, it asks the specific [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) object to update *its own* content using its `setContent` method (as discussed in [Chapter 1: Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)).\n6.  **Confirmation & Display**: The `Game Grid State` confirms the update, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (or another component like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md)) updates the visual display for the player.\n\n#### Code Deep Dive\n\nLet's look at a more complete (but still simplified) version of our `GameGridState` class, imagining it lives in a file like `src/gameGridState.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// src/gameGridState.ts\nimport { PuzzleSlot } from './puzzleSlot'; // We import our PuzzleSlot class\n\nexport class GameGridState {\n    private slots: PuzzleSlot[][]; // This is where we store all our PuzzleSlot objects\n\n    constructor(rows: number, cols: number) {\n        this.slots = []; // Initialize the 2D array\n        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {\n            this.slots[r] = []; // Create a new row\n            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {\n                // For each position, we create a new PuzzleSlot instance\n                // and place it in our grid. Each slot starts empty.\n                this.slots[r][c] = new PuzzleSlot();\n            }\n        }\n        console.log(`Game Grid State initialized with ${rows} rows and ${cols} columns.`);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the PuzzleSlot object at a specific grid position.\n     * This is an internal helper method.\n     */\n    private getSlot(row: number, col: number): PuzzleSlot | undefined {\n        // Check if the requested coordinates are within our grid boundaries\n        if (row >= 0 && row < this.slots.length && col >= 0 && col < this.slots[0].length) {\n            return this.slots[row][col]; // Return the PuzzleSlot object\n        }\n        return undefined; // If out of bounds, return nothing\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Updates the content of a specific PuzzleSlot on the grid.\n     * This is the method external parts of the game would call.\n     */\n    updateSlotContent(row: number, col: number, newContent: string) {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col); // Find the correct PuzzleSlot\n        if (targetSlot) {\n            targetSlot.setContent(newContent); // Ask the PuzzleSlot to update itself\n            console.log(`Updated slot at (${row},${col}) with: \"${newContent}\"`);\n        } else {\n            console.warn(`Cannot update: Slot at (${row},${col}) does not exist.`);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Gets the current content of a specific PuzzleSlot.\n     */\n    getSlotContent(row: number, col: number): string | undefined {\n        const targetSlot = this.getSlot(row, col);\n        return targetSlot ? targetSlot.getContent() : undefined; // Ask the PuzzleSlot for its content\n    }\n}\n```\n**Explanation:**\n*   **`slots: PuzzleSlot[][]`**: This is the core of `GameGridState`. It's a 2D array (an array of arrays) where each element is an actual `PuzzleSlot` object. This structure perfectly mirrors a grid.\n*   **`constructor(rows, cols)`**: When you create a `GameGridState`, you tell it how big the grid should be. It then loops through each position and creates a new, empty `PuzzleSlot` for it.\n*   **`private getSlot(row, col)`**: This is a helper method (marked `private` because it's mainly for internal use within `GameGridState`). It safely retrieves a `PuzzleSlot` object from the `slots` array based on its coordinates, making sure you don't ask for a slot that doesn't exist.\n*   **`updateSlotContent(row, col, newContent)`**: This is the public method used to change a slot. It first uses `getSlot` to find the right `PuzzleSlot` and then calls that `PuzzleSlot`'s `setContent` method. Notice how `GameGridState` *delegates* the actual content management to the `PuzzleSlot` itself.\n*   **`getSlotContent(row, col)`**: Similarly, this method retrieves the content by asking the specific `PuzzleSlot` for its content using `getContent`.\n\nThis design keeps things organized: `GameGridState` knows *where* all the slots are and how to access them, while each `PuzzleSlot` knows *what* it contains.\n\n### Summary and What's Next\n\nIn this chapter, we've learned that the `Game Grid State` is the central manager for all the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s on our puzzle board. It provides a way to:\n*   Represent the entire puzzle board.\n*   Access and update the content of any specific slot.\n*   Keep track of the current state of the game.\n\nIt's the \"big picture\" that allows our game to understand the overall layout and progress.\n\nNow that we know how to manage the *current* state of our puzzle, a natural question arises: How do we define what the puzzle *should* look like initially? How do we set up the rules or the starting pieces? That's exactly what we'll explore in our next chapter, where we dive into [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)!",
          "# Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](02_game_grid_state.md), we learned about the `Game Grid State`, which is like the current snapshot of our puzzle board – what's in each slot right now. Before that, in [Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md), we met the individual `Puzzle Slot`s, the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to tackle a crucial concept: the `Puzzle Configuration`. If the `Game Grid State` tells us what the puzzle *currently looks like*, the `Puzzle Configuration` tells us *how to build* a specific puzzle from scratch. Think of it as the blueprint or the recipe for a particular puzzle level.\n\n### What Problem Does Puzzle Configuration Solve?\n\nImagine you're designing a new puzzle for our game. You need to decide:\n*   How big should the puzzle board be? (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)\n*   What items should be in each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) when the puzzle starts?\n*   What are the rules for winning this specific puzzle?\n\nWithout a `Puzzle Configuration`, every time you wanted to play a specific puzzle, you'd have to manually set up the board, place all the items, and remember the winning conditions. That's a lot of work and prone to errors!\n\nThe `Puzzle Configuration` solves this by acting as a single, organized place to store *all* the information needed to define a unique puzzle level. It's like a recipe card for a specific cake: it lists all the ingredients, their quantities, and the baking instructions, so anyone can make that exact cake again and again.\n\n### What's Inside a Puzzle Configuration?\n\nA `Puzzle Configuration` holds all the essential details that make one puzzle different from another. Here are the key pieces of information it typically contains:\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions**: The width and height of the puzzle board.\n2.  **Initial Slot Contents**: For each [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) on the grid, what item (if any) should it contain when the puzzle begins?\n3.  **Winning Conditions**: What needs to happen for the player to win this puzzle? (e.g., \"all slots must be empty,\" \"specific slots must contain specific items,\" \"a certain pattern must be formed\").\n\nLet's visualize this relationship:\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class PuzzleConfiguration {\n        +int width\n        +int height\n        +List~SlotDefinition~ initialSlots\n        +WinningCondition winningCondition\n    }\n    class SlotDefinition {\n        +int x\n        +int y\n        +string initialItem\n    }\n    class WinningCondition {\n        +string type\n        +object details\n    }\n\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"*\" SlotDefinition : defines initial state for\n    PuzzleConfiguration \"1\" *-- \"1\" WinningCondition : specifies\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n*   `PuzzleConfiguration` is our main concept.\n*   It has `width` and `height` to define the grid size.\n*   `initialSlots` is a list of `SlotDefinition`s. Each `SlotDefinition` tells us what should be in a specific `(x, y)` coordinate at the start. This is how we define the initial state of our [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n*   `WinningCondition` describes what makes the puzzle complete.\n\n### How to Define a Puzzle Configuration\n\nLet's say we want to create a very simple 2x2 puzzle. We want it to start with an \"A\" in the top-left corner and an \"B\" in the top-right, with the rest empty. The winning condition is that all slots must be empty.\n\nHere's how we might define this `Puzzle Configuration` in a simplified way:\n\n```typescript\n// Example: Defining a simple 2x2 puzzle configuration\nconst simplePuzzleConfig = {\n  width: 2,\n  height: 2,\n  initialSlots: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, item: \"A\" }, // Top-left slot has 'A'\n    { x: 1, y: 0, item: \"B\" }  // Top-right slot has 'B'\n    // Other slots (0,1) and (1,1) are implicitly empty\n  ],\n  winningCondition: {\n    type: \"all_empty\" // Player wins when all slots are empty\n  }\n};\n\nconsole.log(\"Defined a puzzle configuration:\", simplePuzzleConfig);\n// Output: Defined a puzzle configuration: { width: 2, height: 2, ... }\n```\n\nThis `simplePuzzleConfig` object is now a complete \"recipe\" for our 2x2 puzzle. It's a data structure that can be saved, loaded, and shared. When our game starts, it can read this configuration to set up the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\n### Under the Hood: How Puzzle Configuration is Used\n\nSo, we have this `Puzzle Configuration` object. How does the system actually use it to create a playable puzzle?\n\nThink of it as a sequence of events:\n\n1.  **Design**: A puzzle designer (or you, using a tool like the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) later) creates a `Puzzle Configuration`.\n2.  **Save/Load**: This configuration is saved (e.g., to a file) and can be loaded by the game.\n3.  **Initialization**: When a player selects a puzzle level, the game loads its corresponding `Puzzle Configuration`.\n4.  **Setup**: The `Puzzle Engine` (which we'll explore in the next chapter!) reads this configuration and uses it to build the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). It creates all the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, places the initial items, and stores the winning conditions.\n\nHere's a simplified sequence diagram showing this process:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant PuzzleEditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant PuzzleEngine as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GameGridState as Game Grid State\n\n    User->>PuzzleEditorUI: Designs a new puzzle\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: Creates/updates configuration data\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEditorUI: Returns configuration\n    PuzzleEditorUI->>User: Saves puzzle level\n\n    User->>PuzzleEngine: Selects a puzzle level\n    PuzzleEngine->>PuzzleConfig: Loads configuration for level\n    PuzzleConfig-->>PuzzleEngine: Provides configuration data\n    PuzzleEngine->>GameGridState: Initializes grid based on config\n    GameGridState-->>PuzzleEngine: Initial grid ready\n    PuzzleEngine->>User: Presents playable puzzle\n```\n\nIn this flow, the `Puzzle Configuration` acts as the bridge between the puzzle's design and its actual playable state. It's a static description that the dynamic parts of our system (like the `Puzzle Engine` and `Game Grid State`) use to come to life.\n\n### A Glimpse at the Code Structure\n\nWhile the exact implementation can vary, a `Puzzle Configuration` might be represented by a class or an interface that ensures all necessary information is present.\n\nLet's imagine a basic `PuzzleConfiguration` class:\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzle-config.ts (conceptual file)\n\n// Defines what an individual slot should contain initially\ninterface SlotDefinition {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n  item: string | null; // 'null' means empty\n}\n\n// Defines the winning condition for a puzzle\ninterface WinningCondition {\n  type: \"all_empty\" | \"match_pattern\"; // Example types\n  // ... other details based on type\n}\n\nexport class PuzzleConfiguration {\n  readonly width: number;\n  readonly height: number;\n  readonly initialSlots: SlotDefinition[];\n  readonly winningCondition: WinningCondition;\n\n  constructor(width: number, height: number, initialSlots: SlotDefinition[], winningCondition: WinningCondition) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    this.initialSlots = initialSlots;\n    this.winningCondition = winningCondition;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis `PuzzleConfiguration` class provides a structured way to hold all the \"recipe\" information. When the game needs to start a new level, it creates an instance of this class, populating it with the specific details for that level. The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this instance and uses its `width`, `height`, and `initialSlots` to construct the initial [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) with all its [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s correctly set up.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the `Puzzle Configuration`, the essential blueprint for any puzzle level in our game. We learned that it defines the puzzle's dimensions, its starting layout of [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, and its winning conditions. It's the static data that brings a specific puzzle to life, acting as a recipe for the dynamic [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md).\n\nNow that we know how a puzzle is *defined*, the next logical step is to understand how it actually *runs*! In our next chapter, we'll dive into the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), which is responsible for taking a `Puzzle Configuration` and making it an interactive, playable experience.",
          "# Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](03_puzzle_configuration.md), we learned about the `Puzzle Configuration`, which is like the rulebook and initial setup instructions for our puzzle game. Before that, we explored the `Game Grid State` ([Chapter 2](02_game_grid_state.md)), which is the current snapshot of our puzzle board, and the individual `Puzzle Slot`s ([Chapter 1](01_puzzle_slot.md)), the building blocks of our grid.\n\nToday, we're going to meet the \"brain\" of our puzzle system: the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### What Problem Does the Puzzle Engine Solve?\n\nImagine you have a board game. You have the board pieces (`Puzzle Slot`s), you know where they are right now (`Game Grid State`), and you have the rulebook (`Puzzle Configuration`). But who actually *plays* the game? Who makes sure moves are valid? Who updates the board when a piece moves? Who tells you when you've won?\n\nThat's exactly what the `Puzzle Engine` does! It's the active component that takes the rules and the current state and *makes the game happen*. It's like the game master or the referee that understands all the rules and manages the flow of play.\n\n**Use Case**: A player clicks on a `Puzzle Slot` to try and make a move. How does the game know if that move is allowed? How does it update the board if it is? The `Puzzle Engine` is responsible for answering these questions and performing the necessary actions.\n\n### The Brain of the Operation\n\nThe `Puzzle Engine` is the central orchestrator for gameplay. Its main jobs include:\n\n1.  **Validating Moves**: When a player tries to do something (like swap two pieces), the `Puzzle Engine` checks the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if that action is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`.\n2.  **Applying Moves**: If a move is valid, the `Puzzle Engine` updates the `Game Grid State` to reflect the change. This might involve changing what's inside one or more `Puzzle Slot`s.\n3.  **Checking Win Conditions**: After each move, or at specific times, the `Puzzle Engine` consults the `Puzzle Configuration` to determine if the player has met the conditions to win the puzzle.\n4.  **Managing Game Flow**: It ensures the game progresses according to its rules.\n\nThink of it this way:\n*   The `Puzzle Configuration` is the *recipe*.\n*   The `Game Grid State` is the *ingredients and what's currently cooking*.\n*   The `Puzzle Engine` is the *chef* who follows the recipe to cook the meal and decides when it's done!\n\n### How the Puzzle Engine Works (High-Level)\n\nLet's trace our use case: a player wants to make a move.\n\n1.  The player interacts with the game (e.g., clicks a `Puzzle Slot`). This interaction is captured by the `Input Controller` (which we'll cover in [Chapter 5: Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n2.  The `Input Controller` tells the `Puzzle Engine` what the player tried to do.\n3.  The `Puzzle Engine` then takes this player action, looks at the current `Game Grid State`, and consults the `Puzzle Configuration` (the rules).\n4.  Based on the rules, it decides if the move is valid.\n5.  If valid, it updates the `Game Grid State` (changing the contents of `Puzzle Slot`s).\n6.  Finally, it checks if the puzzle is now solved.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n\n    Player->>IC: Tries to make a move (e.g., click)\n    IC->>PE: Request to make move(slotId, action)\n    PE->>GGS: Get current state of slot(s)\n    PE->>PC: Check rules for move validity\n    alt Move is Valid\n        PE->>GGS: Update state (change Puzzle Slot content)\n        PE->>PC: Check for win condition\n        alt Puzzle is Solved\n            PE-->>Player: Puzzle Solved!\n        else\n            PE-->>Player: Move successful!\n        end\n    else Move is Invalid\n        PE-->>Player: Invalid move!\n    end\n```\n\n### Inside the Puzzle Engine\n\nLet's look at a very simplified idea of what the `Puzzle Engine` might look like in code. Remember, we're keeping it super simple to understand the core idea!\n\nImagine a basic `PuzzleEngine` class that needs to know about the `Game Grid State` and the `Puzzle Configuration` to do its job.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified example)\n\nimport { GameGridState } from './game_grid_state'; // From Chapter 2\nimport { PuzzleConfiguration } from './puzzle_configuration'; // From Chapter 3\n\nclass PuzzleEngine {\n  private gridState: GameGridState;\n  private config: PuzzleConfiguration;\n\n  constructor(initialConfig: PuzzleConfiguration) {\n    this.config = initialConfig;\n    // The engine creates the initial game state based on the configuration\n    this.gridState = new GameGridState(initialConfig.initialLayout);\n  }\n\n  // ... other methods like checkWinCondition, etc.\n}\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n*   The `PuzzleEngine` takes a `PuzzleConfiguration` when it's created. This gives it all the rules and the starting layout.\n*   It then uses this configuration to create an initial `GameGridState`. This means our engine is ready to manage a specific puzzle!\n\nNow, let's see how it might handle a player's move. Let's say our puzzle involves \"flipping\" a `Puzzle Slot`.\n\n```typescript\n// src/puzzleEngine.ts (Simplified makeMove method)\n\n// ... (inside the PuzzleEngine class)\n\n  makeMove(slotId: string): boolean {\n    // 1. Check if the move is valid according to the configuration rules\n    if (!this.config.isValidFlip(slotId, this.gridState)) {\n      console.log(`Move on slot ${slotId} is not allowed!`);\n      return false; // Move is invalid\n    }\n\n    // 2. If valid, apply the move to the Game Grid State\n    this.gridState.flipSlot(slotId); // This changes the Puzzle Slot's content\n    console.log(`Slot ${slotId} was flipped.`);\n\n    // 3. After the move, check if the puzzle is now solved\n    if (this.checkWinCondition()) {\n      console.log(\"Congratulations! Puzzle Solved!\");\n    }\n    return true; // Move was successful\n  }\n\n  checkWinCondition(): boolean {\n    // This method would compare the current gridState with the\n    // win condition defined in the PuzzleConfiguration.\n    // For simplicity, let's imagine a simple check:\n    return this.config.isSolved(this.gridState);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this `makeMove` method:\n*   It first asks the `Puzzle Configuration` (`this.config.isValidFlip`) if the proposed move (flipping `slotId`) is allowed given the current `Game Grid State`. This is where the rules come into play!\n*   If the move is valid, it tells the `Game Grid State` (`this.gridState.flipSlot`) to update itself. This means the `Game Grid State` will modify the specific `Puzzle Slot` at `slotId`.\n*   Finally, it calls `checkWinCondition()`, which again uses the `Puzzle Configuration` to see if the current `Game Grid State` matches the winning pattern.\n\nThis shows how the `Puzzle Engine` acts as the central coordinator, using information from the `Puzzle Configuration` and manipulating the `Game Grid State` (which contains our `Puzzle Slot`s) to manage the game.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've uncovered the role of the `Puzzle Engine`. It's the active \"brain\" of our puzzle system, responsible for interpreting the rules from the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md), managing the current game board through the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), and ensuring the game progresses correctly. It validates player actions, applies changes to the board, and determines when the puzzle is solved.\n\nNow that we understand how the `Puzzle Engine` processes moves, the next logical step is to see how players actually *tell* the engine what they want to do. In our next chapter, we'll explore the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md), which is the bridge between the player and the `Puzzle Engine`.",
          "# Chapter 5: Input Controller\n\nWelcome back, puzzle enthusiasts! In our [previous chapter](04_puzzle_engine.md), we explored the `Puzzle Engine`, which is the \"brain\" of our game, responsible for applying rules and updating the puzzle based on its [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and the current [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md). We've learned about the individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, the grid, the rules, and the engine that makes it all work.\n\nBut how does a player actually *interact* with this amazing system? How does the game know when you want to move a piece, click a button, or solve a puzzle? That's where the `Input Controller` comes in!\n\n### What Problem Does the Input Controller Solve?\n\nImagine you're playing a puzzle game on your computer or phone. You click on a square, or maybe drag a piece from one spot to another. These actions are how you tell the game what you want to do. The game needs a way to \"hear\" these actions, understand them, and then tell the `Puzzle Engine` to react.\n\nThe `Input Controller` is like the game's ears and hands. Its job is to:\n1.  **Listen** for player actions (like mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or touch gestures).\n2.  **Translate** those actions into meaningful game commands (e.g., \"player clicked on slot at row 2, column 3\").\n3.  **Communicate** these commands to the `Puzzle Engine` so the game can respond.\n\nWithout an `Input Controller`, our game would just sit there, beautiful but unresponsive. It's the crucial link that makes the game interactive!\n\n### The Input Controller in Action: A Simple Click\n\nLet's consider a common use case: a player clicks on a specific `Puzzle Slot` on the game board.\n\n**How it works at a high level:**\n\n1.  The player sees the game board on their screen.\n2.  They move their mouse and click on one of the visual representations of a [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n3.  The `Input Controller` detects this click.\n4.  It figures out *which* [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked based on where the mouse was.\n5.  It then tells the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md), \"Hey, the slot at (this row, this column) was just clicked!\"\n6.  The [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) then decides what to do next (e.g., change the slot's content, check for a match, etc.).\n\n### Analogy: The Game's Receptionist\n\nThink of the `Input Controller` as a very efficient receptionist for our puzzle game.\n\n*   **You (the Player)** walk into the game's \"office\" and say, \"I want to interact with this specific part of the puzzle!\" (This is your mouse click or keyboard press).\n*   **The Receptionist (Input Controller)** hears you, understands *what* you're pointing at, and figures out *which* part of the puzzle you mean.\n*   The receptionist then goes to **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** and says, \"The player wants to do something with the puzzle piece in slot A3.\"\n*   **The Manager (Puzzle Engine)** then decides if that action is allowed according to the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and updates the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md) accordingly.\n\n### Inside the Input Controller: How it Listens and Commands\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how an `Input Controller` might be set up to listen for clicks.\n\n```typescript\n// src/input_controller.ts (Simplified example)\n\n// We need to tell the Input Controller about our Puzzle Engine\nimport { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md'; \n\nclass InputController {\n    private puzzleEngine: PuzzleEngine; // Our game's brain\n\n    constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine) {\n        this.puzzleEngine = engine;\n        // This line tells the browser to listen for clicks on our 'game-board' element.\n        // When a click happens, it calls our 'handleClick' method.\n        document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));\n        console.log(\"Input Controller is now listening for clicks!\");\n    }\n\n    private handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {\n        // In a real game, we'd calculate which specific Puzzle Slot was clicked\n        // based on 'event.clientX' and 'event.clientY' and the grid layout.\n        // For this example, let's pretend we figured out it was slot (0,0).\n        const clickedRow = 0;\n        const clickedCol = 0;\n\n        console.log(`Player clicked on slot (${clickedRow}, ${clickedCol})`);\n        \n        // Now, we tell the Puzzle Engine what happened!\n        this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);\n    }\n}\n\n// Example of how you might create and use it in your main application file (src/main.ts)\n// import { PuzzleEngine } from './04_puzzle_engine.md';\n// import { InputController } from './input_controller.ts'; // Assuming this file exists\n\n// const myPuzzleEngine = new PuzzleEngine(somePuzzleConfiguration); // Imagine this is set up\n// const myInputController = new InputController(myPuzzleEngine);\n// myInputController.startListening(); // A method to start the listeners if not in constructor\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`constructor(engine: PuzzleEngine)`**: When we create an `InputController`, we give it a reference to our `PuzzleEngine`. This is crucial because the `Input Controller` needs to *tell* the engine about player actions.\n2.  **`document.getElementById('game-board')?.addEventListener(...)`**: This is how web applications listen for user interactions. We're saying, \"Hey browser, whenever someone clicks on the HTML element with the ID 'game-board', please run our `handleClick` function.\"\n3.  **`handleClick(event: MouseEvent)`**: This function is called every time a click occurs on the game board.\n    *   `event: MouseEvent` contains details about the click, like where on the screen it happened.\n    *   `const clickedRow = 0; const clickedCol = 0;` (Simplified): In a real game, we'd use the `event` data and knowledge of our [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md)'s layout to precisely determine which [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md) was clicked. For this example, we're just hardcoding it to `(0,0)` to keep it simple.\n    *   **`this.puzzleEngine.handleSlotClick(clickedRow, clickedCol);`**: This is the most important part! The `Input Controller` doesn't *do* the game logic itself. It simply translates the player's action into a command and passes it to the `Puzzle Engine`, which is responsible for processing game rules and updating the game state.\n\n### The Flow of an Input\n\nLet's visualize the journey of a player's click through our system:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Player\n    participant UI as Game UI (HTML)\n    participant IC as Input Controller\n    participant PE as Puzzle Engine\n    participant GGS as Game Grid State\n\n    Player->>UI: Clicks on a puzzle slot (e.g., a square on screen)\n    UI->>IC: Notifies of click event (e.g., \"click at x=100, y=50\")\n    IC->>IC: Determines which Puzzle Slot was clicked (e.g., \"slot at row 1, col 2\")\n    IC->>PE: Sends \"SlotClicked\" command (e.g., \"slot(1, 2) clicked\")\n    PE->>GGS: Updates Game Grid State based on game rules\n    GGS-->>PE: State updated (e.g., \"slot(1,2) now contains 'X'\")\n    PE-->>IC: (Optional) Acknowledges or provides feedback\n    IC-->>UI: (Optional) Triggers UI update to show new game state\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `Input Controller` acts as the crucial intermediary. It takes raw user input, makes sense of it in the context of our game, and then hands off a clear instruction to the `Puzzle Engine`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Input Controller` is a vital component that bridges the gap between the player and the game's internal logic. It listens for player actions, translates them into game-specific commands, and then passes these commands to the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) for processing. Without it, our beautifully configured puzzles and powerful engine would remain untouched and unplayable. It's what makes our game interactive and fun!\n\nNext, we'll shift gears from playing the game to *creating* the game. We'll explore the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), which is a visual tool designed to help puzzle creators build and configure new puzzles using all the concepts we've learned so far.",
          "# Chapter 6: Puzzle Editor UI\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](05_input_controller.md), we explored the `Input Controller`, which is all about how players interact with an *already existing* puzzle game – clicking, dragging, and making moves. It's the bridge between a player's actions and the game's logic.\n\nBut what if you want to create a *brand new* puzzle? How do you design the starting layout, decide which slots are empty, or place specific items? That's where the `Puzzle Editor UI` comes in!\n\n### The Puzzle Designer's Workbench\n\nImagine you're not just a player, but a puzzle designer. You have an idea for a challenging new puzzle. You need a tool, a \"workbench,\" where you can visually lay out your puzzle, slot by slot, until it looks just right. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is exactly that workbench.\n\nIts main job is to provide a friendly visual interface that allows you to easily create and modify a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md). Remember, the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) is the blueprint for a puzzle – it defines its initial state and rules. The `Puzzle Editor UI` is the tool you use to *draw* that blueprint.\n\n**Use Case**: Let's say you want to design a simple 2x2 puzzle. You want the top-left slot to contain a 'star', the top-right to be 'empty', the bottom-left to contain a 'circle', and the bottom-right to be 'empty'. The `Puzzle Editor UI` lets you click on a visual grid and assign these values, then save your creation.\n\n### What is a UI? (User Interface)\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's quickly clarify \"UI.\" UI stands for **User Interface**. It's simply anything you see and interact with on a screen – buttons, menus, text fields, and in our case, a visual representation of a puzzle grid. It's how a human tells a computer what to do, and how the computer shows information back to the human.\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is the visual part of our system that lets you \"talk\" to the puzzle creation process.\n\n### How the Puzzle Editor UI Works\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` essentially does two main things:\n\n1.  **Visualizes a Puzzle**: It displays a grid, much like the [Game Grid State](02_game_grid_state.md), but for editing purposes. Each square in this grid represents a potential [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md).\n2.  **Allows Interaction**: You can click on these squares (slots) to change what they contain (e.g., from empty to a star, or a circle). It also provides buttons to save your work.\n\nWhen you save your puzzle in the editor, it takes all your visual choices and packages them up into a structured data format – specifically, a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object. This object can then be used by the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) to run the game, or by the [HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md) to create a playable version.\n\n#### Step-by-Step: Designing a Puzzle\n\nLet's walk through how you'd use the `Puzzle Editor UI` to create our 2x2 puzzle:\n\n1.  **Open the Editor**: You'd launch the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It might show you an empty grid or load a previously saved puzzle.\n2.  **See the Grid**: The UI displays a grid of editable [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n    *(Imagine this is a visual grid in your browser)*\n3.  **Click to Edit**: You click on the top-left slot. A small menu might pop up, or the slot might cycle through different types (empty, star, circle). You select 'star'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    |   |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n4.  **Continue Editing**: You click the bottom-left slot and select 'circle'.\n    ```\n    +---+---+\n    | ★ |   |\n    +---+---+\n    | ● |   |\n    +---+---+\n    ```\n5.  **Save Your Work**: Once you're happy with your design, you click a \"Save Puzzle\" button.\n\nWhat happens behind the scenes when you click \"Save\"? The `Puzzle Editor UI` gathers all the information about your visually designed grid and converts it into a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) data structure.\n\nHere's a simplified example of what that saved configuration might look like (as we discussed in [Chapter 3: Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)):\n\n```javascript\n// This is the Puzzle Configuration generated by the UI\nconst myNewPuzzleConfig = {\n  id: \"my-first-2x2-puzzle\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  // ... other rules and settings (simplified for example)\n};\n```\n**Output**: The `Puzzle Editor UI` doesn't output a visual, but rather a data structure (like the `myNewPuzzleConfig` above) that describes your puzzle. This data can then be stored and used later.\n\n### Under the Hood: How the Editor Works\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `Puzzle Editor UI` manages to turn your clicks into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\n#### The Editor's Internal Process\n\nWhen you interact with the `Puzzle Editor UI`, here's a simplified sequence of events:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant EditorUI as Puzzle Editor UI\n    participant InternalGridData as Editor's Internal Grid Data\n    participant PuzzleConfig as Puzzle Configuration (File/Object)\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 1. Opens Editor\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 2. Initializes/Loads blank grid\n    EditorUI-->>User: 3. Displays empty grid\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 4. Clicks on a slot (e.g., top-left)\n    EditorUI->>InternalGridData: 5. Updates internal data for that slot (e.g., \"star\")\n    EditorUI-->>User: 6. Updates visual display of the slot\n\n    User->>EditorUI: 7. Clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\n    EditorUI->>PuzzleConfig: 8. Converts InternalGridData to Puzzle Configuration format\n    PuzzleConfig-->>EditorUI: 9. Returns generated config data\n    EditorUI-->>User: 10. Confirms puzzle saved\n```\n\n1.  **Initialization**: When you open the editor, it creates an internal representation of the puzzle grid. This is like a temporary scratchpad where it keeps track of what you're designing.\n2.  **User Interaction**: When you click a slot, the `Puzzle Editor UI` updates this internal scratchpad. It doesn't immediately create a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) file; it just notes down your changes.\n3.  **Saving**: Only when you click \"Save\" does the `Puzzle Editor UI` take everything on its scratchpad and carefully package it into the official [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) format. This format is what the rest of our system understands.\n\n#### Simplified Code Example (Internal Logic)\n\nLet's imagine a very basic way the `Puzzle Editor UI` might manage its internal grid data and then generate a configuration.\n\nFirst, the editor needs a way to store the current state of the puzzle being designed. This could be a simple array of arrays, similar to how `initialState` is represented in a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md):\n\n```javascript\n// Inside the Puzzle Editor UI's logic\nlet currentEditorGrid = [\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"],\n  [\"empty\", \"empty\"]\n];\n\n// This represents the 2x2 grid the user sees and interacts with.\n```\nWhen a user clicks on a slot, the editor updates this `currentEditorGrid`. For instance, if the user clicks the top-left slot (row 0, column 0) and sets it to 'star':\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when a user clicks a slot in the UI\nfunction updateSlotInEditor(row, col, value) {\n  currentEditorGrid[row][col] = value;\n  console.log(`Slot (${row}, ${col}) updated to: ${value}`);\n  // The UI would then visually update the displayed slot\n}\n\n// Example: User sets top-left to 'star'\nupdateSlotInEditor(0, 0, \"star\");\n// Example: User sets bottom-left to 'circle'\nupdateSlotInEditor(1, 0, \"circle\");\n\n// currentEditorGrid is now:\n// [\n//   [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n//   [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n// ]\n```\n**Output**: The `console.log` shows the internal update. Visually, the editor would change the appearance of the clicked slot.\n\nFinally, when the user clicks \"Save,\" the `Puzzle Editor UI` takes this `currentEditorGrid` and wraps it into a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object:\n\n```javascript\n// Function called when the user clicks \"Save Puzzle\"\nfunction generatePuzzleConfiguration() {\n  const rows = currentEditorGrid.length;\n  const cols = currentEditorGrid[0].length;\n\n  const newConfig = {\n    id: \"user-designed-puzzle-\" + Date.now(), // Unique ID\n    gridSize: { rows: rows, cols: cols },\n    initialState: currentEditorGrid,\n    // Add other default rules or settings here\n    rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n  };\n\n  console.log(\"Generated Puzzle Configuration:\", newConfig);\n  // This 'newConfig' would then be saved to a file or database.\n  return newConfig;\n}\n\nconst savedConfig = generatePuzzleConfiguration();\n```\n**Output**:\n```\nGenerated Puzzle Configuration: {\n  id: \"user-designed-puzzle-...\",\n  gridSize: { rows: 2, cols: 2 },\n  initialState: [\n    [\"star\", \"empty\"],\n    [\"circle\", \"empty\"]\n  ],\n  rules: { /* ... default rules ... */ }\n}\n```\nThis `newConfig` is the valuable output of the `Puzzle Editor UI`. It's a complete blueprint ready for the game!\n\nWhile the `src/config.ts` file (which might contain general settings like `port` or `database`) isn't directly involved in the *logic* of generating a puzzle configuration, a real-world `Puzzle Editor UI` might use such a configuration file to know *where* to save the generated puzzle configurations (e.g., to a specific database or API endpoint).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Puzzle Editor UI` is your creative hub for designing new puzzles. It provides a visual interface to interact with and modify the layout of a puzzle grid. By clicking and selecting items for individual [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md)s, you build up your desired puzzle. When you save, the editor translates your visual design into a structured [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) object, which is the blueprint for any new puzzle. It's the essential tool for anyone who wants to move beyond playing and start creating!\n\nNow that we know how to *create* a puzzle's blueprint using the `Puzzle Editor UI`, the next logical step is to turn that blueprint into a playable game that someone can actually see and interact with in a web browser. In our next chapter, we'll explore the `HTML Game Generator`, which takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) and builds the actual web page for the game.\n\n[Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator](07_html_game_generator.md)",
          "# Chapter 7: HTML Game Generator\n\nWelcome back, aspiring puzzle game developers! In our [previous chapter](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md), we explored the `Puzzle Editor UI`. That's where you, the game designer, get to be creative – dragging, dropping, and arranging elements to craft amazing new puzzles. You learned how to define the starting layout and rules, essentially creating a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n\nBut once you've designed a masterpiece in the editor, what's next? How do you let someone *play* your game without them needing to open the editor themselves? How do you share your creation with friends, or even upload it to a website?\n\nThis is exactly the problem the `HTML Game Generator` solves! It's like taking your carefully prepared puzzle recipe (the [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) and baking it into a delicious, ready-to-eat cake (a standalone HTML game file) that anyone can enjoy with just a web browser.\n\n### What is the HTML Game Generator?\n\nAt its core, the `HTML Game Generator` is a special tool that takes all the information about your puzzle – its size, initial items, and rules (your [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md)) – and packages it into a single, self-contained `.html` file. This file contains everything needed to play the game:\n\n*   The puzzle's data.\n*   The game's logic (like the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) and [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md)).\n*   The visual presentation (HTML and CSS).\n\nThink of it as a \"game exporter.\" You design the puzzle, and the generator creates the playable version.\n\n### Why Do We Need It?\n\nImagine you've spent hours crafting a challenging new puzzle. You want to share it!\n\n*   **For Players**: Players don't need to see the complex editor. They just want to click a file and start playing. The `HTML Game Generator` provides this simple, direct experience.\n*   **For Sharing**: You can send a single `.html` file to a friend, and they can open it in Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser. No installation, no special software needed!\n*   **For Deployment**: If you want to put your game on a website, you can simply upload the generated HTML file.\n\nWithout the `HTML Game Generator`, your amazing puzzles would be stuck inside the editor, unable to be easily shared or played by others.\n\n### How It Works: The Big Picture\n\nThe process is quite straightforward:\n\n1.  You provide the `HTML Game Generator` with a complete [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md).\n2.  It takes a basic HTML template (like a blank canvas for a web page).\n3.  It then \"fills in\" this template by embedding your puzzle's data directly into the HTML.\n4.  It also adds all the necessary JavaScript code for the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) (to run the game logic) and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) (to handle player clicks/drags).\n5.  Finally, it gives you back a single string of text, which is the complete HTML content for your game. You can then save this string to a `.html` file.\n\nHere's a simple diagram to visualize this process:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Puzzle Configuration] --> B{HTML Game Generator};\n    C[HTML Template] --> B;\n    D[Game Logic (JS/CSS)] --> B;\n    B --> E[Generated HTML File];\n```\n\n### Using the HTML Game Generator\n\nLet's look at a simplified example of how you might use this generator. Imagine you have a `puzzleConfig` object, which is the result of your work in the [Puzzle Editor UI](06_puzzle_editor_ui.md) and contains all the details of your puzzle.\n\n```typescript\n// Imagine this is our Puzzle Configuration data,\n// created by the Puzzle Editor UI (Chapter 6)\nconst myPuzzleConfig = {\n  gridSize: { rows: 3, cols: 3 },\n  initialState: [\n    { x: 0, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    { x: 1, y: 0, type: 'block' },\n    { x: 2, y: 0, type: 'empty' },\n    // ... more puzzle slot data ...\n  ],\n  rules: [\n    { type: 'move', condition: 'adjacent', action: 'swap' }\n    // ... more rules ...\n  ]\n};\n\n// This function would be part of our HTML Game Generator\nfunction generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n  // Internally, this function builds a big HTML string.\n  // For this example, we'll just show a simplified output.\n  return `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n    const initialConfig = ${JSON.stringify(config)};\n    // ... game engine and input controller code would go here ...\n  </script></body></html>`;\n}\n\n// Now, let's generate the HTML for our puzzle!\nconst gameHtmlContent = generateGameHtml(myPuzzleConfig);\n\nconsole.log(\"Generated HTML starts with:\", gameHtmlContent.substring(0, 100));\n// Output: Generated HTML starts with: <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...</head><body><script>\n//         const initialConfig = {\n```\n\nIn this example, `generateGameHtml` takes your `myPuzzleConfig` and returns a long string that represents a complete HTML file. You would then save this string to a file named `my_awesome_puzzle.html`, and anyone could open it in their browser to play!\n\n### Under the Hood: How It Generates the HTML\n\nLet's peek behind the curtain to see how the `HTML Game Generator` actually constructs that HTML file. It's like a chef assembling a meal: they start with a plate (the HTML template), add the main dish (your puzzle data), and then add the sauces and garnishes (the game logic scripts).\n\nHere's a step-by-step flow of what happens:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Caller as Puzzle Editor UI (or similar)\n    participant HGG as HTML Game Generator\n    participant Template as HTML Template File\n    participant PC as Puzzle Configuration\n    participant GameScripts as Game Logic Scripts\n    participant Output as Generated HTML String\n\n    Caller->>HGG: Request game HTML (puzzleConfig)\n    HGG->>Template: Read base HTML structure\n    HGG->>PC: Get serialized puzzle data (JSON)\n    HGG->>GameScripts: Read Puzzle Engine & Input Controller code\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed puzzle data into template\n    HGG->>HGG: Embed game scripts into template\n    HGG->>Output: Return complete HTML string\n    Output-->>Caller: HTML content ready\n```\n\nLet's look at a simplified conceptual code snippet that shows how this might work:\n\n```typescript\n// src/htmlGameGenerator.ts (Conceptual)\n\n// Imagine this is a basic HTML structure with placeholders\n// for where our puzzle data and game scripts will go.\nconst baseHtmlTemplate = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Generated Puzzle Game</title>\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: sans-serif; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; margin: 0; background-color: #f0f0f0; }\n        #game-container { border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; background-color: white; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"game-container\">\n        <!-- The game will render here -->\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        // This is where our puzzle configuration will be injected!\n        const initialPuzzleConfig = {{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}};\n    </script>\n    <script>{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n`;\n\n// In a real system, these functions would read actual JavaScript files\n// containing the code for the Puzzle Engine and Input Controller.\nfunction getGameEngineScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 4: Puzzle Engine\n    return `\n        // Simplified Puzzle Engine code\n        class PuzzleEngine {\n            constructor(config) { console.log(\"Engine initialized with config:\", config); }\n            applyMove(state, move) { console.log(\"Applying move:\", move); return state; }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\nfunction getInputControllerScript(): string {\n    // This would load the code from Chapter 5: Input Controller\n    return `\n        // Simplified Input Controller code\n        class InputController {\n            constructor(gameElement, engine) {\n                console.log(\"Input Controller ready for:\", gameElement);\n                gameElement.addEventListener('click', () => engine.applyMove({}, 'click'));\n            }\n        }\n    `;\n}\n\n// This is the main function of our HTML Game Generator\nexport function generateGameHtml(config: any): string {\n    // 1. Convert the puzzle configuration object into a JSON string.\n    //    This makes it easy to embed directly into JavaScript.\n    const configJson = JSON.stringify(config, null, 2); // 'null, 2' makes it nicely formatted\n\n    // 2. Gather all the necessary game logic scripts.\n    //    This includes the Puzzle Engine, Input Controller, and any\n    //    code to actually start the game.\n    const allGameScripts = `\n        ${getGameEngineScript()}\n        ${getInputControllerScript()}\n\n        // Code to initialize and start the game when the page loads\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n            const gameContainer = document.getElementById('game-container');\n            const engine = new PuzzleEngine(initialPuzzleConfig);\n            new InputController(gameContainer, engine);\n            console.log(\"Game started!\");\n            // In a real game, the engine would render the initial state here\n        });\n    `;\n\n    // 3. Replace the placeholders in our base HTML template\n    //    with the actual puzzle data and game scripts.\n    let finalHtml = baseHtmlTemplate\n        .replace('{{PUZZLE_CONFIG_DATA}}', configJson)\n        .replace('{{GAME_SCRIPTS}}', allGameScripts);\n\n    return finalHtml;\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `generateGameHtml` function acts as an assembler. It takes your puzzle's blueprint (`config`), fetches the standard parts (template, engine code, input code), and then carefully puts them all together into a single, functional HTML file.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored the `HTML Game Generator`, a vital component that bridges the gap between designing a puzzle and playing it. We learned that:\n\n*   It takes a [Puzzle Configuration](03_puzzle_configuration.md) (the rules and initial state of your puzzle).\n*   It combines this data with a basic HTML structure, the [Puzzle Engine](04_puzzle_engine.md) logic, and the [Input Controller](05_input_controller.md) code.\n*   The result is a single, standalone `.html` file that can be opened in any web browser, making your puzzle playable and easily shareable.\n\nThis concludes our journey through the core components of our puzzle game system! We've covered everything from the smallest building block, the [Puzzle Slot](01_puzzle_slot.md), to how the entire game is packaged for players. You now have a solid understanding of how these pieces work together to create a complete and interactive puzzle experience."
